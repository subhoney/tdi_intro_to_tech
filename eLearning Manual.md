## Welcome to the TDI Introduction to Tech course

TDI is Technical Diving International, the largest and most widely recognized technical diver training organization worldwide. We are committed to offering the highest quality programs, supported by the latest materials, with the most up to date practical information and innovative techniques. Our instructors are held to the highest standards to ensure quality training in all TDI programs conducted worldwide.

In the past, many sport divers were unnecessarily intimidated by technical diving, and thus were reluctant to explore this advanced aspect of recreational diving. Some may have been puzzled by the apparently alien equipment. Others might have had a concern about venturing beyond the traditional sport diving boundaries. Many really didn’t understand what technical diving is all about; a few didn’t even know it existed. At the time there was no single resource geared towards the sport diver that provided an appropriate overview of technical diving.

Intro to Tech is a relatively new addition to the TDI training curriculum, first introduced in 2007. The purpose of this manual, and this course, is to introduce the sport diver to the concepts of technical diving. It focuses primarily on defining the various activities, explaining the equipment, outlining the options, and previewing the information that will be further addressed during formal training in each specialty area. Along the way it will dispel some myths and explore relevant topics. It is not intended, by itself, to make you a full-fledged technical diver; instead, it will help lay a foundation for subsequent technical training, while also enabling you to make informed decisions about your own training path.

We trust that you will find this program both informative and beneficial.

## Some Basic Terminology

As recognized by most authorities, both inside and outside the dive industry, there are three distinct categories of diving: recreational, commercial, and scientific. Recreational diving is a hobby-type activity in which participation is based upon personal enjoyment, while both commercial and scientific diving conversely are vocational pursuits. Naturally, each category of diving is subject to its own protocols and participant qualifications.

Even within the dive industry, some have misconstrued the term recreational diving as applying only to a specific and limited range of sport diving activities, and have mistakenly labeled technical diving as something other than recreational diving. In fact, technical diving is an advanced form of recreational diving. Thus, throughout this text the term sport diving will be used to identify the more traditional aspects of recreational diving, and thereby segregate such activities from the advanced practices and procedures of technical diving.

## Key Contrasts: Technical vs. Sport Diving

As will be readily apparent to most readers, sport diving represents the majority of overall recreational diving activities. Sport diving is widely enjoyed by many participants, often in warm and exotic locations, typically using a relatively simple equipment kit and often requiring only basic entry-level training. Yes, there are advanced sport dives that require some additional training and perhaps a little extra equipment, but for many participants, these advanced activities represent the exception rather than the norm in their diving routine. Most new divers consider their entry level training to have been quite comprehensive, but in actuality, this initial curriculum is streamlined to present only information that is deemed essential; and essential is often defined in terms of the diving activities and environments to which the average sport diver will most likely be exposed.

There is a clear consensus among certification agencies concerning the scope of sport diving; in fact, sport diving is most often identified by its well-established parameters and limitations. The standard scuba unit for sport divers is open circuit scuba with a single cylinder. Novice divers are usually restricted to a depth of 20 metres or 60 feet, while the maximum depth limit for all sport diving is frequently cited as 40 metres or 130 feet. Sport divers are cautioned that they should always avoid entering any overhead environment. Most significantly, sport diving is exclusively no-decompression (or no-stop) diving. The governing principle in sport diving is that the participant will be able to make a direct ascent to the surface at any time.

Conversely, technical diving often is characterized by the fact that it involves activities and environments that are beyond the boundaries of traditional sport diving. It might include staged decompression, alternate breathing gases, or penetration into the dark recesses of wrecks and caves. No, technical divers are not mere renegades who disregard the traditional rules. Technical diving truly is a discipline unto itself. It combines appropriate education, experience, and equipment to enable its practitioners to soundly and safely engage in these types of advanced diving activities.

As will be easily appreciated by the reader, when applied to technical diving, the term essential now encompasses a significantly broader base of knowledge and skills.

By its very nature, technical diving frequently requires additional and/or specialized equipment, far exceeding the traditional scuba unit used by the sport diver. A technical diver usually will stand out from the crowd on a boat shared with sport divers, simply because of his equipment. However, the equipment by itself does not necessarily make a technical diver; this equipment is simply a means to an end, allowing the tech diver to participate in these advanced diving activities.

A sport diver may have the luxury of adopting a rather casual approach to routine diving. With a little experience under his belt, he might be able to gear up and jump into the water with only minimal thought. He may have a loosely-defined route in mind, or perhaps just intends to wander around for a while underwater. Then he'll simply end his dive and surface when . . .

. . . his dive computer suggests an approaching NDL; or
. . . he is beginning to run low on air in his cylinder; or
. . . it's almost time for his dive boat to depart this site; or
. . . he encounters some type of unexpected problem.

The hallmark of technical diving is precise dive planning and execution. Critical components of the planning process include a well-defined route and objective, depth-time considerations and deco obligations, gas selection and effective gas management, and contingency issues. Nothing is routinely left to happenstance. Many technical dives involve staged decompression and, as succinctly noted in the NOAA Diving Manual (4th edition, 2001), "there is no such thing as a casual decompression dive."

Rightly or wrongly, advanced training sometimes might be viewed as optional for the sport diver; however, it is unquestionably a prerequisite in technical diving. Diver safety is the critical factor. Technical diving is not the place for random trial-and-error experimentation by an uninformed amateur, because often there is simply less margin for error. After venturing deep into an overhead environment, or once committed to a decompression profile, the diver will no longer have the option of a direct ascent to the surface. The technical diver must be fully prepared, in terms of equipment, personal skills, and mindset, to effectively deal with any reasonably foreseeable contingency that might arise during a dive.

Technical diving places a heavy emphasis on self-sufficiency, yet at the same time mandates a well-organized and mission-oriented team approach. Close coordination is required among the members of a dive team in terms of gas matching, profile matching, and experience matching. Depending upon the requirements for a particular dive, the members of the team also might extend beyond the primary divers to include additional in-water safety divers and surface support personnel.

## A Bit of History

Modern scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) was invented by Emile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1943. Some earlier systems certainly existed, but left much to be desired. As a French naval officer, Cousteau himself had experienced the dire shortcomings of more primitive underwater equipment. Following deployment by Allied forces in the latter days of World War II, scuba came home to the civilian world with some of the returning veterans.

In the earliest days of recreational diving, the typical dive instructor most frequently was an ex-military diver, and the early civilian training programs naturally mimicked the military regimens. It was not unusual, at that time, for recreational diver training to be extraordinarily lengthy and detailed, as well as physically demanding. Training tended to be all-inclusive, encompassing the full spectrum of all possible diving activities, and routinely addressing a number of now-obscure diving concepts; in particular, decompression diving was a standard part of the training. Consistent with its military heritage and philosophy, diving at that time was not intended for the average person. Clearly the extensive prerequisite training served as a barrier for many, and active participation was effectively limited to the select few who could measure up to those standards.

However, it was soon recognized that sport diving actually could be something quite different than military diving, and therefore the training could be treated accordingly.

Los Angeles County was home to the first civilian diver training organization in the USA in 1954, and by the mid 1960s several other certification agencies had appeared, all under the new banner of recreational diving. A primary goal was standardization and sanctioning of sport diver training. Anxious to attract wider participation, yet with a vigilant eye toward safety, ongoing efforts have been made to dramatically streamline entry-level training while simultaneously narrowing the types of activities deemed appropriate for sport divers. In the process, sport diving evolved into the avocation that we know today, with its standardized training requirements and its well-defined parameters and limitations.

Undoubtedly, during the ensuing years, a few participants felt unnecessarily constrained by the boundaries of sport diving. Some of these individuals started to look elsewhere for tools and techniques that would help expand the range of their personal diving activities. Their focus was turned back toward military diving protocols, as well as forward toward the more recent developments in commercial and scientific diving.

The term technical diving was coined by AquaCorps magazine in 1991 to identify certain advanced diving activities that were clearly outside the mainstream of recreational diving. Though the label itself was new, in fact technical diving already had been around for a number of years, and was continuing to grow in popularity.

An initial focus of early technical divers was nitrox, an alternate breathing mixture for air, whose value already had been demonstrated in the military and scientific diving arenas. Specialized training organizations first offered nitrox training to sport divers in 1985, using materials from NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Initially nitrox was shunned within the recreational diving community, and as recently as 1991 these specialized training organizations were actually banned from a major dive industry event. Of course, since that time, nitrox has gained far wider acceptance, and by 1995 nitrox effectively had made the leap from the technical realm into mainstream sport diving. Today most sport diver training agencies have established their own nitrox diving programs.

In the meantime, those early specialized organizations continued to expand into other areas of advanced diving tools and techniques, and eventually evolved into today’s technical diver training organizations. In particular, TDI can trace its roots directly back to those early nitrox pioneers, and TDI is now recognized as the world’s largest and most innovative technical agency. The current TDI curriculum includes certification courses in Nitrox and Advanced Nitrox, Decompression Procedures and Extended Range Diving, Trimix and Advanced Trimix, Closed Circuit and Semi-Closed Circuit Rebreathers, Advanced Wreck Diving, Cavern and Cave Diving.

Slowly but surely technical diving has gained wider acceptance, and it seems that tech is now the "hot" dive industry buzzword. At recent trade shows (where even nitrox was once unspoken), almost every major manufacturer is promoting some new item of technical gear. Perhaps the most significant indication of the acceptance of tech is the fact that some of the old sport-only training agencies now are starting to dabble with their own version of a technical curriculum.

## Commonalities in Recreactional Diving

First and foremost, diving is diving, whether it is sport or technical in nature. The same principles of physics and physiology apply in each case. Much of the equipment is the same, or at least similar in function and use. Every recreational diver appropriately begins his or her training with the Open Water Diver course. Technical training is an extension of sport diving, building upon that foundation provided by each diver’s prior training and experience.

Some sport diver programs effectively serve as preparatory introductions to technical training; for example, the sport-level Wreck Diver specialty is a prerequisite for the TDI Advanced Wreck Diver course.

Some sport diver skills are directly transferable to technical diving. In order to use a dry suit for technical dives, a diver relies upon the sport-level SDI Dry Suit Diver specialty for appropriate training. The skills learned in the SDI Underwater Navigation Specialty course are equally applicable to both sport and technical dives. The sport-level SDI Rescue Diver training is highly recommended for all divers, regardless of their interests or activities.

Both sport and technical diving have a progressive curriculum of continuing education, yet each also offers a variety of programs that allow individual divers to tailor their training to match their personal interests. Looking at it another way, sport and technical are simply catch-phrases that help to characterize and differentiate general types of underwater activities within the broader category of recreational diving.

## Personal Considerations

Is technical diving for you? That’s a personal and very individual decision because, quite candidly, it is not right for everyone. Your TDI instructor can and will assist you in evaluating whether you’re ready, based upon your past training and experience. In fact, some instructors routinely conduct a counseling session with each student prior to enrolling in a technical course, to address these specific issues. Assuming that prerequisites have been fulfilled, the ultimate question then becomes whether technical diving is something that you really want to try.

Gliding along a shallow reef in warm tropical waters is definitely an enjoyable experience. For some recreational divers, this is all they ever seek to do, and they have no interest in going further. They are sport divers by choice. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that!

Maybe you want to stay a little longer than allowed by traditional sport diving limits, or go a little deeper, or take a peek inside that wreck or cave. You have the desire to safely and soundly extend your diving beyond the realm of the average recreational diver. And you are prepared to make the necessary investment in terms of training and equipment. Then you’re likely a candidate for technical training.

Perhaps you just want to know more about diving in general, such as how the laws of physics affect your body while underwater, and how you can properly deal with those effects. Yes, technical training addresses such issues in far greater detail. But maybe you’re not quite sure how far you want to go in technical diving. That’s fine! There’s a range of technical programs that allow you to tailor your training to match your personal interests.

Maybe you still enjoy those shallow tropical reefs. No problem! You do not need to abandon all sport diving activities once you become a technical diver. Most technical divers still enjoy, quite thoroughly, that casual spin around the reef. Technical diving is simply an extension of their other recreational diving activities.

Clearly, the advanced knowledge and skills gained through technical training will help the participant become a more comfortable, capable, and confident diver overall.

## General Equipment Issues

Equipment configuration may be one of the most obvious characteristics that visually distinguish the technical diver from the traditional sport diver.

Actually, the basic technical set-up shares much in common with its sport diving equivalent. Both consist of four key components: (1) a pressurized supply of breathing gas; (2) a regulator system to deliver the gas to the diver; (3) a BC to carry the gas cylinders and also to provide complete buoyancy control; and (4) instrumentation to monitor all vital information related to depth, time, and gas supply. However there also are some significant differences, between the sport and technical set-ups, as will be addressed in this chapter.

In addition to the basic set-up, the standard equipment unit for technical diving frequently includes other items and accessories that may be a bit alien to the sport diver.

In terms of equipment selection and configuration, the seasoned technical diver is governed by two key principles. First, he ensures that he has the proper equipment for a particular dive, including redundancy of all critical equipment. Second, he seeks to streamline his overall equipment configuration through careful arrangement of required components, and also by eliminating any accessory items that are unnecessary for a particular dive.

## Primary Cylinders

Air is everything! In selecting equipment for a planned dive, the technical diver’s first concern will be his supply of breathing gas, based upon the requirements for a particular dive, as well as a suitable reserve for contingencies. Technical diving may involve extended bottom times, perhaps at relatively deep depths, with additional time spent underwater during mandatory decompression stops. Sometimes a diver will be able to meet his gas supply requirements with a single high-capacity cylinder, though more frequently he will opt for double cylinders. In addition to volume, double cylinders offer an advantage to the technical diver in terms of redundancy.

The preferred and most effective method for using double cylinders is to join them together into a single unit with an isolation manifold. This configuration allows for two separate (redundant) first stage regulators to be used, with one first stage attached to the outlet valve on each side of the manifold. With the isolation valve open, each regulator is able to deliver gas to the diver from both cylinders.

Manifold.jpg

In the event of a regulator failure resulting in a free-flow, the diver can readily reach back and shut down the outlet valve for the affected regulator. By doing so, the wasteful discharge of gas can be eliminated. Then, even with that one regulator shut down, the diver still will be able to draw upon the contents of both cylinders through his remaining regulator.

Isolate Manifold.jpg

Though fairly rare, it is also possible to experience a catastrophic loss of gas due to a cylinder or valve failure. Such a situation might involve a ruptured neck o-ring (where the valve attaches into the cylinder), or a ruptured burst disk (pressure-relief mechanism, located in the body of a valve between the cylinder and the valve’s internal mechanism). In this case there is nothing a diver can do underwater to shut down the actual leak; however, the diver can segregate the offending o-ring or burst disk by closing the manifold’s isolation valve, thus limiting the loss of gas to the affected side, while preserving the gas in his remaining cylinder.

Isolate Manifold.jpg

An alternate approach involves the use of independent double cylinders, banded together on the diver’s back, but not connected by a manifold. With independent doubles, a first stage is simply attached to the valve on each cylinder. Similar to the case with an isolation manifold, this arrangement offers some advantage in the event of a failure in the neck o-ring or burst disk of one cylinder. However, it also presents several disadvantages. First, periodically and repeatedly throughout his dive, the diver will need to switch from one regulator to another, in order to balance the quantity of gas being consumed from each cylinder. This is required for reasons related to both gas management and buoyancy characteristics. Second, in the event of a regulator failure, the diver will not only lose use of that regulator, but also will lose access to the gas supply in the cylinder to which it is attached.

Another increasingly popular option is the use of sidemounted cylinders. These are independent cylinders worn on the side of the divers body rather than on the front. Sidemount shares many of the advantages and disadvantages for independent doubles. In addition sidemount allows for easier access to the valves in the case of a free flow and a lower overall profile when vertical clearance is a problem such as in some overhead environments. However, hose routing and cylinder attachment can be more complicated and the width of the setup can make it poorly suited for hard boat diving.

It is possible to achieve redundancy in first stage regulators, while using only a single cylinder. This is accomplished by having the cylinder fitted with a dual-outlet valve, which then allows two first stages to be attached. Of course, by itself, this configuration provides no redundancy in the diver’s gas supply in the event of an o-ring or burst disk failure.

When using only a single cylinder, redundancy in gas supply may be provided through the addition of a pony bottle, worn on the diver’s back alongside his primary cylinder. In such a case it is vitally important that this pony bottle be of sufficient volume to allow the diver to return from his deepest depth and complete all required decompression stops on his way to the surface. Of course, when diving in an overhead environment, the technical diver must consider not only his vertical depth from the surface, but also his horizontal depth into the wreck or cave.

Cylinder valves are often available with a choice of either DIN or yoke fittings. In many cases either will work equally well. However, technical divers tend to prefer the DIN fitting because it completely encloses and internally traps that critical O-ring where the first stage mates to the valve, and its threaded (screw-in) connection generally provides a more secure attachment in the event of accidental impact (such as colliding with an unnoticed overhead obstacle while diving inside a cave or wreck).

As will be addressed later in this course, technical divers may employ breathing gases other than air. Whenever an alternate gas is used, the primary cylinders need to be appropriately prepared and labeled, and a completed contents tag should be affixed to the cylinders.

## Auxiliary Cylinders

While the sport diver typically uses only a single breathing mixture during a dive, the technical diver has the option of employing multiple gases for maximum benefit throughout his dive.

With appropriate training, a technical diver may utilize a high-content deco gas (50% to 100% oxygen) during his staged decompression stops, either for physiological advantage or to significantly reduce the time required at those stops.

Aux_Cylinders.jpg

A pony-size cylinder typically is used for the deco gas. Sometimes it is carried by the diver throughout his entire dive, while other times it may be left by the diver in a rendezvous location for later retrieval. It is normally attached to the front of the BC, with its valve-end clipped to a D-ring on the diver’s chest and its base-end clipped to another D-ring near the diver’s hip. Some divers prefer to wear the deco cylinder diagonally across the torso, while others prefer to have it attached more toward one side and tucked under the arm.

The high-content deco gas, if inadvertently used at a deeper depth, will pose a significant risk of CNS (central nervous system) oxygen toxicity. Thus, it is standard practice to label this cylinder quite prominently, for ready identification by both the diver and his buddy. In addition, the deco cylinder is normally carried with the regulator pressurized to preclude water from entering the regulator, but with the valve turned off so as to minimize the risk of accidentally breathing this mix at depth. This same procedure, with the regulator pressurized and the valve turned-off, also works well when the deco cylinder is left at a rendezvous location, as it prevents any free-flow loss of gas during the diver’s absence.

In addition to the deco gas, some technical divers also elect to carry a travel gas in an additional auxiliary cylinder. This travel gas may be used during the diver’s descent prior to switching over to the bottom gas in his primary cylinders, and/or during the ascent prior to switching over to his deco gas. A travel cylinder is rigged in the same manner as the deco cylinder; some divers prefer to wear the deco and travel cylinders on opposite sides of their body, while others prefer to carry them both on the same side and positioned one below the other.

## Regulators

Technical diving often places increased physical demands upon the diver due to extended depth (and a corresponding increased density of the breathing gas), the additional drag caused by the diver’s expanded gear configuration, and other environmental factors. Middle-of-the-line regulators, popular among sport divers, generally are not suitable for technical applications because of their greater breathing resistance at deeper depths (which by itself will increase a diver’s overall workload), and the possibility that this type of regulator simply may not deliver a sufficient quantity of breathing gas to meet the increased physical demands. Naturally, a technical diver should seek only high-performance regulators for use on his primary cylinders – this includes both high-performance first stages and high-performance second stages, because each component in the regulator system will have a direct impact upon overall performance.

The same considerations may not necessarily apply to the regulator used on a deco cylinder. The technical diver will employ his deco gas at a relatively shallow depth, while he is basically at rest. Here, a lower-performance regulator may be adequate, so long as the diver can breathe comfortably with it during his decompression stops.

As suggested above, a first stage regulator should be attached to every valve on each primary and auxiliary cylinder. First stages typically are available with a choice of DIN or yoke fittings, corresponding to the choice in cylinder valves. For reasons previously outlined (captured O-ring, more secure connection), technical divers generally prefer a DIN fitting. In addition, as a matter of convenience, the DIN regulator is more “universal” in nature since it also may be used with a non-DIN valve through the simple addition of a yoke adapter. For the aspiring technical diver who already owns a high-performance yoke regulator, the local dive center usually will be able to convert it to DIN. No matter which type of first stage you choose, DIN or yoke, all first stages should be the same style, all DIN or all yoke.

It is important to note that there are actually two types (or sizes) of DIN fittings for both cylinder valves and regulator first stages. The 200 bar valve has a relatively shallow threaded outlet, and the corresponding 200 bar first stage has a relatively short threaded stem; these are intended for low-pressure service (200 bar / 3000 psi or less). The 300 bar valve has a deeper threaded outlet, and the corresponding 300 bar first stage has a longer threaded stem; these are intended for high-pressure service (greater than 200 bar / 3000 psi). The type of valve (200 bar or 300 bar) is dictated by the working pressure of the cylinder, while the type of regulator fitting (200 bar or 300 bar) is dictated by the pressure rating for the first stage. Naturally, the 200 bar first stage, with its shorter stem, will only seal properly in the shallower 200 bar valve. However, the 300 bar first stage, with its longer stem, will seal properly in both 200 bar and 300 bar valves.

At least one second stage regulator should be attached to each first stage, on any cylinder containing a breathing gas. Generally, there is no need to attach an additional second stage (as an alternate, also known as an octopus or safe-second) to any first stage, except perhaps in the case where a diver is using a single cylinder equipped with a single-outlet valve. In most technical diving configurations with double cylinders or dual-outlet valves the alternate second stage routinely is attached to its own first stage.

Due to the bulk of the technical equipment, especially when an auxiliary cylinder is also included, the traditional hose length for the alternate second stage may prove to be too short for effectively sharing air with another diver. Thus many technical divers equip one of their second stages with a longer hose, often about 2 metres or 7 feet in length. In certain air sharing situations the long hose will offer the additional advantage of permitting two divers to swim side-by-side, instead of forcing them into a face-to-face orientation. Some advanced wreck and cave divers employ an even longer hose, perhaps about 3 metres or 10 feet in length, allowing one diver to be positioned directly behind the other while swimming through a narrow passageway.

Based upon past sport diving experience, some readers automatically may assume that the long hose will be added to the alternate second stage. Such is consistent with the notion that the alternate will then be passed by the donor to another diver in an out-of-air emergency. In fact, this approach has been adopted by some technical divers and when so used, the long hose typically is bungeed or wrapped to keep it out of the way, yet allow it to be quickly deployed when needed. Conversely and more commonly, other technical divers prefer to add the long hose to their primary second stage, with the intent that the primary will be passed to another diver in an out-of-air emergency, and that the donor then will switch over to his own alternate. There are a couple of reasons behind this approach. First, a panicked and out-of-air diver often grabs instinctively for the regulator in the donor's mouth; in anticipation of such a situation, the donor simply configures his equipment to accommodate this panic reaction. Second, for reasons of economy, some divers will use a slightly lower-performance regulator for their alternate and recognize that, in a stressful emergency situation, the out-of-air recipient may well be the one who is most in need of the higher-performance primary regulator. While the excess length of hose sometimes may be bungeed, here it is more common to route the long hose under the diver's right arm, down near his right hip (and perhaps tucking or loosely securing it at this point), then diagonally up and left across his chest, behind his neck, and finally to his mouth. When passing this regulator to an out-of-air buddy, the donor often needs only to tip his head forward to free the long hose from behind his neck and deploy it at full length.

In sport diving, to streamline his equipment a diver occasionally adopts the system where the alternate second stage is integrated into his BC inflator mechanism. Such a configuration is generally unsuitable for technical applications - after passing his own primary regulator, the dangling inflator-integrated alternate second stage may be difficult for the donor to locate, and it too easily can become entangled with other gear or be trapped beneath his deco cylinder.

Regardless of the configuration, it is important that the diver's alternate second stage be appropriately secured and positioned, ready for immediate deployment. In cases where the donor intends to pass his alternate to another diver in an emergency, he has several options (improvised or commercially available) for properly securing the alternate at the front of his chest; these basically involve the same techniques as used in sport diving. Where the donor intends to pass his primary second stage to another diver, he often will fashion a necklace-like device of surgical tubing to secure his alternate just below his chin, for his own immediate use.

Entanglement is a hazard encountered in both sport and technical diving. Yet in some sport diving configurations the various hoses that are attached to the first stage (linking it to second stages, inflators, and gauges) may be routinely arranged in a manner that forms large loops of hose extending outward on either side of the diver. Obviously any protruding hose is a potential point of entanglement and in technical configurations, a concerted effort is made to route all hoses so as to eliminate or at least minimize this problem. Proper hose routing can be a bit of an art, but the objective is to keep the hoses tucked in behind the diver as much as possible. With double cylinders this may be facilitated by attaching the hoses from the right side of the diver to the left first stage and vice versa; basically, the hoses are arranged to point inward and/or downward from each first stage, rather than pointing directly outward. Naturally, to maintain redundancy the hoses for any similar items (such as two second stages, or the BC and dry suit inflators) always should be routed to separate first stages.

When a cylinder contains nitrox, the attached regulator (and all accessories connected to that regular) must be suitable for such nitrox use; in particular, any items attached to a deco cylinder will generally require special preparation for oxygen service.

## Buoyancy Compensators

In sport diving, to streamline his equipment a diver occasionally adopts the system where the alternate second stage is integrated into his BC inflator mechanism. Such a configuration is generally unsuitable for technical applications - after passing his own primary regulator, the dangling inflator-integrated alternate second stage may be difficult for the donor to locate, and it too easily can become entangled with other gear or be trapped beneath his deco cylinder.

Regardless of the configuration, it is important that the diver's alternate second stage be appropriately secured and positioned, ready for immediate deployment. In cases where the donor intends to pass his alternate to another diver in an emergency, he has several options (improvised or commercially available) for properly securing the alternate at the front of his chest; these basically involve the same techniques as used in sport diving. Where the donor intends to pass his primary second stage to another diver, he often will fashion a necklace-like device of surgical tubing to secure his alternate just below his chin, for his own immediate use.

## Instrumentation

With an eye towards redundancy, the technical diver should be equipped with a minimum of two depth measuring devices and two timing devices. This may be accomplished through any combination of mechanical or electronic instruments such as depth gauges, dive watches and bottom timers, and/or personal dive computers.

It is important for the diver to carefully review the owner's manual and thoroughly evaluate the full capabilities of his dive computer prior to any attempt at using it in technical diving activities. There is a wide assortment of dive computers currently available; the specific features and capabilities can vary significantly between the various models. For the sake of discussion, dive computers may be considered in terms of three broad categories.

Some low-end dive computers are intended exclusively for sport diving, and may enter a "lock-out mode" (shutting down and ceasing to function for a specified period of time) whenever a no-deco limit is exceeded. This type of computer is clearly unsuitable for decompression diving. However, some of these models might offer an alternate "gauge mode" where the calculating functions can be turned off, and the unit then will serve simply as an electronic depth gauge and bottom timer for use with dive tables in deco applications.

Though intended primarily for sport diving use, some dive computers also will handle deco calculations quite effectively during the dive; however, they may lack the features to thoroughly plan a decompression profile ahead of time. This type can be very useful for monitoring actual decompression status during a dive, but will require the diver to rely upon dive tables for all pre-dive deco planning. Often, this mid-range type of dive computer will be nitrox-programmable, but typically only for a single breathing mix.

Technical dive computers are specifically designed for decompression diving; in addition to monitoring deco status during the dive, they also accommodate detailed pre-dive deco planning. Often, these units will be programmable for multiple breathing mixes, allowing a diver to take full advantage of the various options related to deco gases. High-end technical models also may be trimix-programmable and rebreather-compatible. While it would be ideal for the diver to be equipped with two identical technical dive computers, some technical divers routinely depend upon the use of dive tables (and related manual calculations) for some or all of their pre-dive planning, and they routinely rely upon depth gauges and bottom timers for some or all of their instrumentation.

In addition to depth and time monitoring, the diver also needs to monitor his gas supplies. At least one SPG (submersible pressure gauge) is needed for double-cylinders with an isolation manifold, and some divers prefer to use two SPGs with this configuration (one on each side, in the event that one side needs to be shut down). When employing independent doubles, an SPG will be needed on each cylinder. Naturally, an SPG is also needed when using a single primary cylinder. In addition, an SPG is commonly used on all pony bottles and auxiliary cylinders.

When a cylinder contains nitrox, the attached SPG (or air-integrated dive computer) must be suitable for such nitrox use; in particular, any SPG (or air-integrated dive computer) that is attached to a deco cylinder will generally require special preparation for oxygen service.

Because of the number of required instruments, a diver typically will carry at least some of his instruments in a console secured to his rig. Other instruments normally will be worn on the wrist. For a deco or travel cylinder, the SPG will normally be bungeed or otherwise secured to the cylinder itself.

## Exposure Protection

Appropriate exposure protection is a concern in all types of diving. This concern is amplified in some types of technical diving where the diver will experience extended time at depth, plus additional time coupled with limited physical activity during mandatory deco stops; therefore, decompression diving usually requires an increased level of exposure protection (as compared to no-stop sport diving in the same environment). Certainly, a heavier-weight wetsuit will work well in some situations, but often the technical diver will opt for a dry suit, even in relatively warm water.

Personal comfort is not the only issue. Cold can reduce a diver’s overall level of alertness, and negatively influence his rational thought processes. Cold also can have an adverse impact upon a diver’s susceptibility to decompression sickness. Thus, in addition to comfort, exposure protection is a safety issue.

Correctly or incorrectly, some sport divers have adopted the technique of relying upon dry suit inflation as their primary means of buoyancy control while underwater. With the significantly greater weight of technical gear, such an approach is often no longer practical; the dry suit simply would be far too over-inflated. Typically, the technical diver limits his suit inflation to the minimum required for warmth and comfort, and otherwise utilizes his BCD for buoyancy control. However, as previously noted, the dry suit also may be employed for redundant buoyancy on an emergency basis.

To further enhance the insulating properties of his dry suit in cold water, a diver may elect to use argon (an inert gas) for suit inflation. Argon has a far lower level of thermal conductivity than air or other breathing gases. The supply of argon is carried in a small cylinder, typically attached to the side of the BCD harness or backplate, tucked behind the diver; a standard first stage and inflator hose are used with this cylinder for dry suit inflation. Naturally, the argon cylinder should be prominently labeled, and frequently it is also painted an orange color to avoid any confusion regarding its contents. If inhaled, argon can cause anoxia and significant narcosis.

Editor's note: _Anoxia_ is the total absense of oxygen; compare with _hypoxia_, where oxygen is present in breathing gas, but not in enough of a quantity to support metabolization. Breathing from an argon cylinder will cause anoxia, while breating a 12% O2 cylinder (at the surface) will cause hypoxia.

## Weights

The technical diver will usually require some sort of weight system. This may be in the form of a weight belt, a weight harness, or weight pockets integrated into the BCD, and may include any combination of these systems. Because of the added weight of his gear configuration, the technical diver may require far less lead in his weight system than his sport diving counterpart. It is important, however, for the technical diver to realize that he is carrying a substantial quantity of breathing gas, which contributes to the initial weight of his gear and will be consumed during his dive. Therefore, the diver should properly determine his weighting requirements based upon buoyancy characteristics at the end of his dive, so that he will be able to maintain effective control during any safety or decompression stops. It is also noted that improper weighting (either over-weighting or under-weighting) can result in both over-exertion and increased gas consumption throughout the dive.

## Cutting Devices

The technical diver should be equipped with a minimum of two cutting devices. These may be any combination of dive knifes, shears, or line cutters. It is important that at least one of these devices be easily accessible to the diver with either hand; this means that the primary cutting device is usually positioned somewhere on the BCD in front of the diver’s torso. The additional (redundant) cutting device, depending upon type, may be strapped to the diver’s leg, stored in a pocket, or otherwise attached to his scuba unit.

The knife has long been the diver’s standard cutting tool, and it will serve quite effectively in many emergency situations such as when a diver needs to cut himself free of an entanglement with kelp or monofilament fishing line. However, a diver might encounter other entanglement hazards that are not as easily cut; these can include electrical wires and cables that dangle around a wreck, the metal leaders on some fishing lines, and the materials used in constructing heavier fishing nets. For dealing with these difficult-to-cut hazards, shears often are more effective than a knife. Some equipment manufacturers offer heavy-duty shears specifically designed for dive use. Some divers alternately opt for less expensive utility scissors (sometimes referred to as paramedic shears); these are often available from dive suCutting Devices 2ppliers, and also can be found in the tool aisle of some discount retail stores. Lineman’s pliers or side-cutters from the local hardware store also may be useful but, because these items normally are not made of stainless steel, they require greater care to minimize rust and corrosion. Some divers routinely add a pocket-size multi-tool (with folding pliers, screwdrivers, etc.) to their kit, and without a doubt it will prove helpful for simple topside repairs; but before counting on such a device for emergency underwater use, the diver must ensure that he can reliably access its various cutting features while wearing dive gloves.

## Underwater Slates, Lift Bag and Reel and Surface Signals

### Underwater Slates

All divers have routine need for a slate. It is most frequently used in underwater communication between dive buddies. It also is essential for making notes and drawing maps of underwater sites.

In addition, a separate slate carried in a pocket or worn on the wrist is a critically important piece of equipment for the technical diver as this is where he records the details of his dive plan and mandatory decompression stops. This slate will serve as the primary reference when using a depth gauge and bottom timer, or as a back-up reference when using a dive computer.

Editor's note: The GUE metholdoly for underwater communication is wetNotes, and I agree with this over slates. They are carried in the right drysuit thigh pocket, bungeed in as normal.

### Lift Bag and Reel

The reader might immediately recognize the traditional purposes for these two items – the lift bag can be used to recover heavy objects off the bottom, and the reel can be used for navigation in situations where limited visibility is a factor.

These items serve additional roles in technical diving. The lift bag may be employed as a redundant source of buoyancy control in the event of a catastrophic BCD failure. The lift bag and reel, in combination, may be used as a surface marker and possible signaling device. In situations where the diver cannot use the anchor line or other fixed line for his ascent, the lift bag and reel, again in combination, will provide an effective ascent platform for the diver as he returns towards the surface and completes his required decompression stops.

Editor's note: the eLearning manual includes an embedded link to a 1min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRke6Nc5ODk) of some surface skills.

### Surface Signals

Depending upon location and circumstances, at a minimum each diver should be equipped with both an audible and a visual surface signaling device. A simple whistle has long been the standard audible signal. For greater effectiveness, the diver might also consider one of the air-powered horn-like devices that are attached in-line on the BCD inflator hose. A brightly colored inflatable tube, sometimes referred to as a safety sausage, makes an effective visual device that is especially advantageous in rough seas. The diver also might consider a signaling mirror, or the signal flares specially intended for divers.
