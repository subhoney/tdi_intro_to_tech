## Welcome to the TDI Introduction to Tech course

TDI is Technical Diving International, the largest and most widely recognized technical diver training organization worldwide. We are committed to offering the highest quality programs, supported by the latest materials, with the most up to date practical information and innovative techniques. Our instructors are held to the highest standards to ensure quality training in all TDI programs conducted worldwide.

In the past, many sport divers were unnecessarily intimidated by technical diving, and thus were reluctant to explore this advanced aspect of recreational diving. Some may have been puzzled by the apparently alien equipment. Others might have had a concern about venturing beyond the traditional sport diving boundaries. Many really didn’t understand what technical diving is all about; a few didn’t even know it existed. At the time there was no single resource geared towards the sport diver that provided an appropriate overview of technical diving.

Intro to Tech is a relatively new addition to the TDI training curriculum, first introduced in 2007. The purpose of this manual, and this course, is to introduce the sport diver to the concepts of technical diving. It focuses primarily on defining the various activities, explaining the equipment, outlining the options, and previewing the information that will be further addressed during formal training in each specialty area. Along the way it will dispel some myths and explore relevant topics. It is not intended, by itself, to make you a full-fledged technical diver; instead, it will help lay a foundation for subsequent technical training, while also enabling you to make informed decisions about your own training path.

We trust that you will find this program both informative and beneficial.

_Safe Diving!_

## Some Basic Terminology

As recognized by most authorities, both inside and outside the dive industry, there are three distinct categories of diving: recreational, commercial, and scientific. Recreational diving is a hobby-type activity in which participation is based upon personal enjoyment, while both commercial and scientific diving conversely are vocational pursuits. Naturally, each category of diving is subject to its own protocols and participant qualifications.

Even within the dive industry, some have misconstrued the term recreational diving as applying only to a specific and limited range of sport diving activities, and have mistakenly labeled technical diving as something other than recreational diving. In fact, technical diving is an advanced form of recreational diving. Thus, throughout this text the term sport diving will be used to identify the more traditional aspects of recreational diving, and thereby segregate such activities from the advanced practices and procedures of technical diving.

## Key Contrasts: Technical vs. Sport Diving

As will be readily apparent to most readers, sport diving represents the majority of overall recreational diving activities. Sport diving is widely enjoyed by many participants, often in warm and exotic locations, typically using a relatively simple equipment kit and often requiring only basic entry-level training. Yes, there are advanced sport dives that require some additional training and perhaps a little extra equipment, but for many participants, these advanced activities represent the exception rather than the norm in their diving routine. Most new divers consider their entry level training to have been quite comprehensive, but in actuality, this initial curriculum is streamlined to present only information that is deemed essential; and essential is often defined in terms of the diving activities and environments to which the average sport diver will most likely be exposed.

There is a clear consensus among certification agencies concerning the scope of sport diving; in fact, sport diving is most often identified by its well-established parameters and limitations. The standard scuba unit for sport divers is open circuit scuba with a single cylinder. Novice divers are usually restricted to a depth of 20 metres or 60 feet, while the maximum depth limit for all sport diving is frequently cited as 40 metres or 130 feet. Sport divers are cautioned that they should always avoid entering any overhead environment. Most significantly, sport diving is exclusively no-decompression (or no-stop) diving. The governing principle in sport diving is that the participant will be able to make a direct ascent to the surface at any time.

Conversely, technical diving often is characterized by the fact that it involves activities and environments that are beyond the boundaries of traditional sport diving. It might include staged decompression, alternate breathing gases, or penetration into the dark recesses of wrecks and caves. No, technical divers are not mere renegades who disregard the traditional rules. Technical diving truly is a discipline unto itself. It combines appropriate education, experience, and equipment to enable its practitioners to soundly and safely engage in these types of advanced diving activities.

As will be easily appreciated by the reader, when applied to technical diving, the term essential now encompasses a significantly broader base of knowledge and skills.

By its very nature, technical diving frequently requires additional and/or specialized equipment, far exceeding the traditional scuba unit used by the sport diver. A technical diver usually will stand out from the crowd on a boat shared with sport divers, simply because of his equipment. However, the equipment by itself does not necessarily make a technical diver; this equipment is simply a means to an end, allowing the tech diver to participate in these advanced diving activities.

A sport diver may have the luxury of adopting a rather casual approach to routine diving. With a little experience under his belt, he might be able to gear up and jump into the water with only minimal thought. He may have a loosely-defined route in mind, or perhaps just intends to wander around for a while underwater. Then he'll simply end his dive and surface when . . .

. . . his dive computer suggests an approaching NDL; or
. . . he is beginning to run low on air in his cylinder; or
. . . it's almost time for his dive boat to depart this site; or
. . . he encounters some type of unexpected problem.

The hallmark of technical diving is precise dive planning and execution. Critical components of the planning process include a well-defined route and objective, depth-time considerations and deco obligations, gas selection and effective gas management, and contingency issues. Nothing is routinely left to happenstance. Many technical dives involve staged decompression and, as succinctly noted in the NOAA Diving Manual (4th edition, 2001), "there is no such thing as a casual decompression dive."

Rightly or wrongly, advanced training sometimes might be viewed as optional for the sport diver; however, it is unquestionably a prerequisite in technical diving. Diver safety is the critical factor. Technical diving is not the place for random trial-and-error experimentation by an uninformed amateur, because often there is simply less margin for error. After venturing deep into an overhead environment, or once committed to a decompression profile, the diver will no longer have the option of a direct ascent to the surface. The technical diver must be fully prepared, in terms of equipment, personal skills, and mindset, to effectively deal with any reasonably foreseeable contingency that might arise during a dive.

Technical diving places a heavy emphasis on self-sufficiency, yet at the same time mandates a well-organized and mission-oriented team approach. Close coordination is required among the members of a dive team in terms of gas matching, profile matching, and experience matching. Depending upon the requirements for a particular dive, the members of the team also might extend beyond the primary divers to include additional in-water safety divers and surface support personnel.

## A Bit of History

Modern scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) was invented by Emile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1943. Some earlier systems certainly existed, but left much to be desired. As a French naval officer, Cousteau himself had experienced the dire shortcomings of more primitive underwater equipment. Following deployment by Allied forces in the latter days of World War II, scuba came home to the civilian world with some of the returning veterans.

In the earliest days of recreational diving, the typical dive instructor most frequently was an ex-military diver, and the early civilian training programs naturally mimicked the military regimens. It was not unusual, at that time, for recreational diver training to be extraordinarily lengthy and detailed, as well as physically demanding. Training tended to be all-inclusive, encompassing the full spectrum of all possible diving activities, and routinely addressing a number of now-obscure diving concepts; in particular, decompression diving was a standard part of the training. Consistent with its military heritage and philosophy, diving at that time was not intended for the average person. Clearly the extensive prerequisite training served as a barrier for many, and active participation was effectively limited to the select few who could measure up to those standards.

However, it was soon recognized that sport diving actually could be something quite different than military diving, and therefore the training could be treated accordingly.

Los Angeles County was home to the first civilian diver training organization in the USA in 1954, and by the mid 1960s several other certification agencies had appeared, all under the new banner of recreational diving. A primary goal was standardization and sanctioning of sport diver training. Anxious to attract wider participation, yet with a vigilant eye toward safety, ongoing efforts have been made to dramatically streamline entry-level training while simultaneously narrowing the types of activities deemed appropriate for sport divers. In the process, sport diving evolved into the avocation that we know today, with its standardized training requirements and its well-defined parameters and limitations.

Undoubtedly, during the ensuing years, a few participants felt unnecessarily constrained by the boundaries of sport diving. Some of these individuals started to look elsewhere for tools and techniques that would help expand the range of their personal diving activities. Their focus was turned back toward military diving protocols, as well as forward toward the more recent developments in commercial and scientific diving.

The term technical diving was coined by AquaCorps magazine in 1991 to identify certain advanced diving activities that were clearly outside the mainstream of recreational diving. Though the label itself was new, in fact technical diving already had been around for a number of years, and was continuing to grow in popularity.

An initial focus of early technical divers was nitrox, an alternate breathing mixture for air, whose value already had been demonstrated in the military and scientific diving arenas. Specialized training organizations first offered nitrox training to sport divers in 1985, using materials from NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Initially nitrox was shunned within the recreational diving community, and as recently as 1991 these specialized training organizations were actually banned from a major dive industry event. Of course, since that time, nitrox has gained far wider acceptance, and by 1995 nitrox effectively had made the leap from the technical realm into mainstream sport diving. Today most sport diver training agencies have established their own nitrox diving programs.

In the meantime, those early specialized organizations continued to expand into other areas of advanced diving tools and techniques, and eventually evolved into today’s technical diver training organizations. In particular, TDI can trace its roots directly back to those early nitrox pioneers, and TDI is now recognized as the world’s largest and most innovative technical agency. The current TDI curriculum includes certification courses in Nitrox and Advanced Nitrox, Decompression Procedures and Extended Range Diving, Trimix and Advanced Trimix, Closed Circuit and Semi-Closed Circuit Rebreathers, Advanced Wreck Diving, Cavern and Cave Diving.

Slowly but surely technical diving has gained wider acceptance, and it seems that tech is now the "hot" dive industry buzzword. At recent trade shows (where even nitrox was once unspoken), almost every major manufacturer is promoting some new item of technical gear. Perhaps the most significant indication of the acceptance of tech is the fact that some of the old sport-only training agencies now are starting to dabble with their own version of a technical curriculum.

## Commonalities in Recreational Diving

First and foremost, diving is diving, whether it is sport or technical in nature. The same principles of physics and physiology apply in each case. Much of the equipment is the same, or at least similar in function and use. Every recreational diver appropriately begins his or her training with the Open Water Diver course. Technical training is an extension of sport diving, building upon that foundation provided by each diver’s prior training and experience.

Some sport diver programs effectively serve as preparatory introductions to technical training; for example, the sport-level Wreck Diver specialty is a prerequisite for the TDI Advanced Wreck Diver course.

Some sport diver skills are directly transferable to technical diving. In order to use a dry suit for technical dives, a diver relies upon the sport-level SDI Dry Suit Diver specialty for appropriate training. The skills learned in the SDI Underwater Navigation Specialty course are equally applicable to both sport and technical dives. The sport-level SDI Rescue Diver training is highly recommended for all divers, regardless of their interests or activities.

Both sport and technical diving have a progressive curriculum of continuing education, yet each also offers a variety of programs that allow individual divers to tailor their training to match their personal interests. Looking at it another way, sport and technical are simply catch-phrases that help to characterize and differentiate general types of underwater activities within the broader category of recreational diving.

## Personal Considerations

Is technical diving for you? That’s a personal and very individual decision because, quite candidly, it is not right for everyone. Your TDI instructor can and will assist you in evaluating whether you’re ready, based upon your past training and experience. In fact, some instructors routinely conduct a counseling session with each student prior to enrolling in a technical course, to address these specific issues. Assuming that prerequisites have been fulfilled, the ultimate question then becomes whether technical diving is something that you really want to try.

Gliding along a shallow reef in warm tropical waters is definitely an enjoyable experience. For some recreational divers, this is all they ever seek to do, and they have no interest in going further. They are sport divers by choice. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that!

Maybe you want to stay a little longer than allowed by traditional sport diving limits, or go a little deeper, or take a peek inside that wreck or cave. You have the desire to safely and soundly extend your diving beyond the realm of the average recreational diver. And you are prepared to make the necessary investment in terms of training and equipment. Then you’re likely a candidate for technical training.

Perhaps you just want to know more about diving in general, such as how the laws of physics affect your body while underwater, and how you can properly deal with those effects. Yes, technical training addresses such issues in far greater detail. But maybe you’re not quite sure how far you want to go in technical diving. That’s fine! There’s a range of technical programs that allow you to tailor your training to match your personal interests.

Maybe you still enjoy those shallow tropical reefs. No problem! You do not need to abandon all sport diving activities once you become a technical diver. Most technical divers still enjoy, quite thoroughly, that casual spin around the reef. Technical diving is simply an extension of their other recreational diving activities.

Clearly, the advanced knowledge and skills gained through technical training will help the participant become a more comfortable, capable, and confident diver overall.

## General Equipment Issues

Equipment configuration may be one of the most obvious characteristics that visually distinguish the technical diver from the traditional sport diver.

Actually, the basic technical set-up shares much in common with its sport diving equivalent. Both consist of four key components: (1) a pressurized supply of breathing gas; (2) a regulator system to deliver the gas to the diver; (3) a BC to carry the gas cylinders and also to provide complete buoyancy control; and (4) instrumentation to monitor all vital information related to depth, time, and gas supply. However there also are some significant differences, between the sport and technical set-ups, as will be addressed in this chapter.

In addition to the basic set-up, the standard equipment unit for technical diving frequently includes other items and accessories that may be a bit alien to the sport diver.

In terms of equipment selection and configuration, the seasoned technical diver is governed by two key principles. First, he ensures that he has the proper equipment for a particular dive, including redundancy of all critical equipment. Second, he seeks to streamline his overall equipment configuration through careful arrangement of required components, and also by eliminating any accessory items that are unnecessary for a particular dive.

## Primary Cylinders

Air is everything! In selecting equipment for a planned dive, the technical diver’s first concern will be his supply of breathing gas, based upon the requirements for a particular dive, as well as a suitable reserve for contingencies. Technical diving may involve extended bottom times, perhaps at relatively deep depths, with additional time spent underwater during mandatory decompression stops. Sometimes a diver will be able to meet his gas supply requirements with a single high-capacity cylinder, though more frequently he will opt for double cylinders. In addition to volume, double cylinders offer an advantage to the technical diver in terms of redundancy.

The preferred and most effective method for using double cylinders is to join them together into a single unit with an isolation manifold. This configuration allows for two separate (redundant) first stage regulators to be used, with one first stage attached to the outlet valve on each side of the manifold. With the isolation valve open, each regulator is able to deliver gas to the diver from both cylinders.

Manifold.jpg

In the event of a regulator failure resulting in a free-flow, the diver can readily reach back and shut down the outlet valve for the affected regulator. By doing so, the wasteful discharge of gas can be eliminated. Then, even with that one regulator shut down, the diver still will be able to draw upon the contents of both cylinders through his remaining regulator.

Isolate Manifold.jpg

Though fairly rare, it is also possible to experience a catastrophic loss of gas due to a cylinder or valve failure. Such a situation might involve a ruptured neck o-ring (where the valve attaches into the cylinder), or a ruptured burst disk (pressure-relief mechanism, located in the body of a valve between the cylinder and the valve’s internal mechanism). In this case there is nothing a diver can do underwater to shut down the actual leak; however, the diver can segregate the offending o-ring or burst disk by closing the manifold’s isolation valve, thus limiting the loss of gas to the affected side, while preserving the gas in his remaining cylinder.

Isolate Manifold.jpg

An alternate approach involves the use of independent double cylinders, banded together on the diver’s back, but not connected by a manifold. With independent doubles, a first stage is simply attached to the valve on each cylinder. Similar to the case with an isolation manifold, this arrangement offers some advantage in the event of a failure in the neck o-ring or burst disk of one cylinder. However, it also presents several disadvantages. First, periodically and repeatedly throughout his dive, the diver will need to switch from one regulator to another, in order to balance the quantity of gas being consumed from each cylinder. This is required for reasons related to both gas management and buoyancy characteristics. Second, in the event of a regulator failure, the diver will not only lose use of that regulator, but also will lose access to the gas supply in the cylinder to which it is attached.

Another increasingly popular option is the use of sidemounted cylinders. These are independent cylinders worn on the side of the divers body rather than on the front. Sidemount shares many of the advantages and disadvantages for independent doubles. In addition sidemount allows for easier access to the valves in the case of a free flow and a lower overall profile when vertical clearance is a problem such as in some overhead environments. However, hose routing and cylinder attachment can be more complicated and the width of the setup can make it poorly suited for hard boat diving.

It is possible to achieve redundancy in first stage regulators, while using only a single cylinder. This is accomplished by having the cylinder fitted with a dual-outlet valve, which then allows two first stages to be attached. Of course, by itself, this configuration provides no redundancy in the diver’s gas supply in the event of an o-ring or burst disk failure.

When using only a single cylinder, redundancy in gas supply may be provided through the addition of a pony bottle, worn on the diver’s back alongside his primary cylinder. In such a case it is vitally important that this pony bottle be of sufficient volume to allow the diver to return from his deepest depth and complete all required decompression stops on his way to the surface. Of course, when diving in an overhead environment, the technical diver must consider not only his vertical depth from the surface, but also his horizontal depth into the wreck or cave.

Cylinder valves are often available with a choice of either DIN or yoke fittings. In many cases either will work equally well. However, technical divers tend to prefer the DIN fitting because it completely encloses and internally traps that critical O-ring where the first stage mates to the valve, and its threaded (screw-in) connection generally provides a more secure attachment in the event of accidental impact (such as colliding with an unnoticed overhead obstacle while diving inside a cave or wreck).

As will be addressed later in this course, technical divers may employ breathing gases other than air. Whenever an alternate gas is used, the primary cylinders need to be appropriately prepared and labeled, and a completed contents tag should be affixed to the cylinders.

## Auxiliary Cylinders

While the sport diver typically uses only a single breathing mixture during a dive, the technical diver has the option of employing multiple gases for maximum benefit throughout his dive.

With appropriate training, a technical diver may utilize a high-content deco gas (50% to 100% oxygen) during his staged decompression stops, either for physiological advantage or to significantly reduce the time required at those stops.

Aux_Cylinders.jpg

A pony-size cylinder typically is used for the deco gas. Sometimes it is carried by the diver throughout his entire dive, while other times it may be left by the diver in a rendezvous location for later retrieval. It is normally attached to the front of the BC, with its valve-end clipped to a D-ring on the diver’s chest and its base-end clipped to another D-ring near the diver’s hip. Some divers prefer to wear the deco cylinder diagonally across the torso, while others prefer to have it attached more toward one side and tucked under the arm.

The high-content deco gas, if inadvertently used at a deeper depth, will pose a significant risk of CNS (central nervous system) oxygen toxicity. Thus, it is standard practice to label this cylinder quite prominently, for ready identification by both the diver and his buddy. In addition, the deco cylinder is normally carried with the regulator pressurized to preclude water from entering the regulator, but with the valve turned off so as to minimize the risk of accidentally breathing this mix at depth. This same procedure, with the regulator pressurized and the valve turned-off, also works well when the deco cylinder is left at a rendezvous location, as it prevents any free-flow loss of gas during the diver’s absence.

In addition to the deco gas, some technical divers also elect to carry a travel gas in an additional auxiliary cylinder. This travel gas may be used during the diver’s descent prior to switching over to the bottom gas in his primary cylinders, and/or during the ascent prior to switching over to his deco gas. A travel cylinder is rigged in the same manner as the deco cylinder; some divers prefer to wear the deco and travel cylinders on opposite sides of their body, while others prefer to carry them both on the same side and positioned one below the other.

## Regulators

Technical diving often places increased physical demands upon the diver due to extended depth (and a corresponding increased density of the breathing gas), the additional drag caused by the diver’s expanded gear configuration, and other environmental factors. Middle-of-the-line regulators, popular among sport divers, generally are not suitable for technical applications because of their greater breathing resistance at deeper depths (which by itself will increase a diver’s overall workload), and the possibility that this type of regulator simply may not deliver a sufficient quantity of breathing gas to meet the increased physical demands. Naturally, a technical diver should seek only high-performance regulators for use on his primary cylinders – this includes both high-performance first stages and high-performance second stages, because each component in the regulator system will have a direct impact upon overall performance.

The same considerations may not necessarily apply to the regulator used on a deco cylinder. The technical diver will employ his deco gas at a relatively shallow depth, while he is basically at rest. Here, a lower-performance regulator may be adequate, so long as the diver can breathe comfortably with it during his decompression stops.

As suggested above, a first stage regulator should be attached to every valve on each primary and auxiliary cylinder. First stages typically are available with a choice of DIN or yoke fittings, corresponding to the choice in cylinder valves. For reasons previously outlined (captured O-ring, more secure connection), technical divers generally prefer a DIN fitting. In addition, as a matter of convenience, the DIN regulator is more “universal” in nature since it also may be used with a non-DIN valve through the simple addition of a yoke adapter. For the aspiring technical diver who already owns a high-performance yoke regulator, the local dive center usually will be able to convert it to DIN. No matter which type of first stage you choose, DIN or yoke, all first stages should be the same style, all DIN or all yoke.

It is important to note that there are actually two types (or sizes) of DIN fittings for both cylinder valves and regulator first stages. The 200 bar valve has a relatively shallow threaded outlet, and the corresponding 200 bar first stage has a relatively short threaded stem; these are intended for low-pressure service (200 bar / 3000 psi or less). The 300 bar valve has a deeper threaded outlet, and the corresponding 300 bar first stage has a longer threaded stem; these are intended for high-pressure service (greater than 200 bar / 3000 psi). The type of valve (200 bar or 300 bar) is dictated by the working pressure of the cylinder, while the type of regulator fitting (200 bar or 300 bar) is dictated by the pressure rating for the first stage. Naturally, the 200 bar first stage, with its shorter stem, will only seal properly in the shallower 200 bar valve. However, the 300 bar first stage, with its longer stem, will seal properly in both 200 bar and 300 bar valves.

At least one second stage regulator should be attached to each first stage, on any cylinder containing a breathing gas. Generally, there is no need to attach an additional second stage (as an alternate, also known as an octopus or safe-second) to any first stage, except perhaps in the case where a diver is using a single cylinder equipped with a single-outlet valve. In most technical diving configurations with double cylinders or dual-outlet valves the alternate second stage routinely is attached to its own first stage.

Due to the bulk of the technical equipment, especially when an auxiliary cylinder is also included, the traditional hose length for the alternate second stage may prove to be too short for effectively sharing air with another diver. Thus many technical divers equip one of their second stages with a longer hose, often about 2 metres or 7 feet in length. In certain air sharing situations the long hose will offer the additional advantage of permitting two divers to swim side-by-side, instead of forcing them into a face-to-face orientation. Some advanced wreck and cave divers employ an even longer hose, perhaps about 3 metres or 10 feet in length, allowing one diver to be positioned directly behind the other while swimming through a narrow passageway.

Based upon past sport diving experience, some readers automatically may assume that the long hose will be added to the alternate second stage. Such is consistent with the notion that the alternate will then be passed by the donor to another diver in an out-of-air emergency. In fact, this approach has been adopted by some technical divers and when so used, the long hose typically is bungeed or wrapped to keep it out of the way, yet allow it to be quickly deployed when needed. Conversely and more commonly, other technical divers prefer to add the long hose to their primary second stage, with the intent that the primary will be passed to another diver in an out-of-air emergency, and that the donor then will switch over to his own alternate. There are a couple of reasons behind this approach. First, a panicked and out-of-air diver often grabs instinctively for the regulator in the donor's mouth; in anticipation of such a situation, the donor simply configures his equipment to accommodate this panic reaction. Second, for reasons of economy, some divers will use a slightly lower-performance regulator for their alternate and recognize that, in a stressful emergency situation, the out-of-air recipient may well be the one who is most in need of the higher-performance primary regulator. While the excess length of hose sometimes may be bungeed, here it is more common to route the long hose under the diver's right arm, down near his right hip (and perhaps tucking or loosely securing it at this point), then diagonally up and left across his chest, behind his neck, and finally to his mouth. When passing this regulator to an out-of-air buddy, the donor often needs only to tip his head forward to free the long hose from behind his neck and deploy it at full length.

In sport diving, to streamline his equipment a diver occasionally adopts the system where the alternate second stage is integrated into his BC inflator mechanism. Such a configuration is generally unsuitable for technical applications - after passing his own primary regulator, the dangling inflator-integrated alternate second stage may be difficult for the donor to locate, and it too easily can become entangled with other gear or be trapped beneath his deco cylinder.

Regardless of the configuration, it is important that the diver's alternate second stage be appropriately secured and positioned, ready for immediate deployment. In cases where the donor intends to pass his alternate to another diver in an emergency, he has several options (improvised or commercially available) for properly securing the alternate at the front of his chest; these basically involve the same techniques as used in sport diving. Where the donor intends to pass his primary second stage to another diver, he often will fashion a necklace-like device of surgical tubing to secure his alternate just below his chin, for his own immediate use.

Entanglement is a hazard encountered in both sport and technical diving. Yet in some sport diving configurations the various hoses that are attached to the first stage (linking it to second stages, inflators, and gauges) may be routinely arranged in a manner that forms large loops of hose extending outward on either side of the diver. Obviously any protruding hose is a potential point of entanglement and in technical configurations, a concerted effort is made to route all hoses so as to eliminate or at least minimize this problem. Proper hose routing can be a bit of an art, but the objective is to keep the hoses tucked in behind the diver as much as possible. With double cylinders this may be facilitated by attaching the hoses from the right side of the diver to the left first stage and vice versa; basically, the hoses are arranged to point inward and/or downward from each first stage, rather than pointing directly outward. Naturally, to maintain redundancy the hoses for any similar items (such as two second stages, or the BC and dry suit inflators) always should be routed to separate first stages.

When a cylinder contains nitrox, the attached regulator (and all accessories connected to that regular) must be suitable for such nitrox use; in particular, any items attached to a deco cylinder will generally require special preparation for oxygen service.

## Buoyancy Compensators

In sport diving, to streamline his equipment a diver occasionally adopts the system where the alternate second stage is integrated into his BC inflator mechanism. Such a configuration is generally unsuitable for technical applications - after passing his own primary regulator, the dangling inflator-integrated alternate second stage may be difficult for the donor to locate, and it too easily can become entangled with other gear or be trapped beneath his deco cylinder.

Regardless of the configuration, it is important that the diver's alternate second stage be appropriately secured and positioned, ready for immediate deployment. In cases where the donor intends to pass his alternate to another diver in an emergency, he has several options (improvised or commercially available) for properly securing the alternate at the front of his chest; these basically involve the same techniques as used in sport diving. Where the donor intends to pass his primary second stage to another diver, he often will fashion a necklace-like device of surgical tubing to secure his alternate just below his chin, for his own immediate use.

Obviously any protruding hose is a potential point of entanglement and in technical configurations, a concerted effort is made to route all hoses so as to eliminate or at least minimize this problem. Proper hose routing can be a bit of an art, but the objective is to keep the hoses tucked in behind the diver as much as possible. With double cylinders this may be facilitated by attaching the hoses from the right side of the diver to the left first stage and vice versa; basically, the hoses are arranged to point inward and/or downward from each first stage, rather than pointing directly outward. Naturally, to maintain redundancy the hoses for any similar items (such as two second stages, or the BC and dry suit inflators) always should be routed to separate first stages.

When a cylinder contains nitrox, the attached regulator (and all accessories connected to that regular) must be suitable for such nitrox use; in particular, any items attached to a deco cylinder will generally require special preparation for oxygen service.

## Instrumentation

With an eye towards redundancy, the technical diver should be equipped with a minimum of two depth measuring devices and two timing devices. This may be accomplished through any combination of mechanical or electronic instruments such as depth gauges, dive watches and bottom timers, and/or personal dive computers.

It is important for the diver to carefully review the owner's manual and thoroughly evaluate the full capabilities of his dive computer prior to any attempt at using it in technical diving activities. There is a wide assortment of dive computers currently available; the specific features and capabilities can vary significantly between the various models. For the sake of discussion, dive computers may be considered in terms of three broad categories.

Some low-end dive computers are intended exclusively for sport diving, and may enter a "lock-out mode" (shutting down and ceasing to function for a specified period of time) whenever a no-deco limit is exceeded. This type of computer is clearly unsuitable for decompression diving. However, some of these models might offer an alternate "gauge mode" where the calculating functions can be turned off, and the unit then will serve simply as an electronic depth gauge and bottom timer for use with dive tables in deco applications.

Though intended primarily for sport diving use, some dive computers also will handle deco calculations quite effectively during the dive; however, they may lack the features to thoroughly plan a decompression profile ahead of time. This type can be very useful for monitoring actual decompression status during a dive, but will require the diver to rely upon dive tables for all pre-dive deco planning. Often, this mid-range type of dive computer will be nitrox-programmable, but typically only for a single breathing mix.

Technical dive computers are specifically designed for decompression diving; in addition to monitoring deco status during the dive, they also accommodate detailed pre-dive deco planning. Often, these units will be programmable for multiple breathing mixes, allowing a diver to take full advantage of the various options related to deco gases. High-end technical models also may be trimix-programmable and rebreather-compatible. While it would be ideal for the diver to be equipped with two identical technical dive computers, some technical divers routinely depend upon the use of dive tables (and related manual calculations) for some or all of their pre-dive planning, and they routinely rely upon depth gauges and bottom timers for some or all of their instrumentation.

In addition to depth and time monitoring, the diver also needs to monitor his gas supplies. At least one SPG (submersible pressure gauge) is needed for double-cylinders with an isolation manifold, and some divers prefer to use two SPGs with this configuration (one on each side, in the event that one side needs to be shut down). When employing independent doubles, an SPG will be needed on each cylinder. Naturally, an SPG is also needed when using a single primary cylinder. In addition, an SPG is commonly used on all pony bottles and auxiliary cylinders.

When a cylinder contains nitrox, the attached SPG (or air-integrated dive computer) must be suitable for such nitrox use; in particular, any SPG (or air-integrated dive computer) that is attached to a deco cylinder will generally require special preparation for oxygen service.

Because of the number of required instruments, a diver typically will carry at least some of his instruments in a console secured to his rig. Other instruments normally will be worn on the wrist. For a deco or travel cylinder, the SPG will normally be bungeed or otherwise secured to the cylinder itself.

## Exposure Protection

Appropriate exposure protection is a concern in all types of diving. This concern is amplified in some types of technical diving where the diver will experience extended time at depth, plus additional time coupled with limited physical activity during mandatory deco stops; therefore, decompression diving usually requires an increased level of exposure protection (as compared to no-stop sport diving in the same environment). Certainly, a heavier-weight wetsuit will work well in some situations, but often the technical diver will opt for a dry suit, even in relatively warm water.

Personal comfort is not the only issue. Cold can reduce a diver’s overall level of alertness, and negatively influence his rational thought processes. Cold also can have an adverse impact upon a diver’s susceptibility to decompression sickness. Thus, in addition to comfort, exposure protection is a safety issue.

Correctly or incorrectly, some sport divers have adopted the technique of relying upon dry suit inflation as their primary means of buoyancy control while underwater. With the significantly greater weight of technical gear, such an approach is often no longer practical; the dry suit simply would be far too over-inflated. Typically, the technical diver limits his suit inflation to the minimum required for warmth and comfort, and otherwise utilizes his BCD for buoyancy control. However, as previously noted, the dry suit also may be employed for redundant buoyancy on an emergency basis.

To further enhance the insulating properties of his dry suit in cold water, a diver may elect to use argon (an inert gas) for suit inflation. Argon has a far lower level of thermal conductivity than air or other breathing gases. The supply of argon is carried in a small cylinder, typically attached to the side of the BCD harness or backplate, tucked behind the diver; a standard first stage and inflator hose are used with this cylinder for dry suit inflation. Naturally, the argon cylinder should be prominently labeled, and frequently it is also painted an orange color to avoid any confusion regarding its contents. If inhaled, argon can cause anoxia and significant narcosis.

Editor's note: _Anoxia_ is the total absence of oxygen; compare with _hypoxia_, where oxygen is present in breathing gas, but not in enough of a quantity to support metabolization. Breathing from an argon cylinder will cause anoxia, while breathing a 12% O2 cylinder (at the surface) will cause hypoxia.

## Weights

weights.jpg

The technical diver will usually require some sort of weight system. This may be in the form of a weight belt, a weight harness, or weight pockets integrated into the BCD, and may include any combination of these systems. Because of the added weight of his gear configuration, the technical diver may require far less lead in his weight system than his sport diving counterpart. It is important, however, for the technical diver to realize that he is carrying a substantial quantity of breathing gas, which contributes to the initial weight of his gear and will be consumed during his dive. Therefore, the diver should properly determine his weighting requirements based upon buoyancy characteristics at the end of his dive, so that he will be able to maintain effective control during any safety or decompression stops. It is also noted that improper weighting (either over-weighting or under-weighting) can result in both over-exertion and increased gas consumption throughout the dive.

## Cutting Devices

trilobyte.jpg

The technical diver should be equipped with a minimum of two cutting devices. These may be any combination of dive knives, shears, or line cutters. It is important that at least one of these devices be easily accessible to the diver with either hand; this means that the primary cutting device is usually positioned somewhere on the BCD in front of the diver’s torso. The additional (redundant) cutting device, depending upon type, may be strapped to the diver’s leg, stored in a pocket, or otherwise attached to his scuba unit.

The knife has long been the diver’s standard cutting tool, and it will serve quite effectively in many emergency situations such as when a diver needs to cut himself free of an entanglement with kelp or monofilament fishing line. However, a diver might encounter other entanglement hazards that are not as easily cut; these can include electrical wires and cables that dangle around a wreck, the metal leaders on some fishing lines, and the materials used in constructing heavier fishing nets. For dealing with these difficult-to-cut hazards, shears often are more effective than a knife. Some equipment manufacturers offer heavy-duty shears specifically designed for dive use. Some divers alternately opt for less expensive utility scissors (sometimes referred to as paramedic shears); these are often available from dive suppliers, and also can be found in the tool aisle of some discount retail stores. Lineman’s pliers or side-cutters from the local hardware store also may be useful but, because these items normally are not made of stainless steel, they require greater care to minimize rust and corrosion. Some divers routinely add a pocket-size multi-tool (with folding pliers, screwdrivers, etc.) to their kit, and without a doubt it will prove helpful for simple topside repairs; but before counting on such a device for emergency underwater use, the diver must ensure that he can reliably access its various cutting features while wearing dive gloves.

## Underwater Slates, Lift Bag and Reel and Surface Signals

### Underwater Slates

All divers have routine need for a slate. It is most frequently used in underwater communication between dive buddies. It also is essential for making notes and drawing maps of underwater sites.

slate.jpg

In addition, a separate slate carried in a pocket or worn on the wrist is a critically important piece of equipment for the technical diver as this is where he records the details of his dive plan and mandatory decompression stops. This slate will serve as the primary reference when using a depth gauge and bottom timer, or as a back-up reference when using a dive computer.

Editor's note: The GUE methodology for underwater communication is wetNotes, and I agree with this over slates. They are carried in the right drysuit thigh pocket, bungeed in as normal.

### Lift Bag and Reel

The reader might immediately recognize the traditional purposes for these two items – the lift bag can be used to recover heavy objects off the bottom, and the reel can be used for navigation in situations where limited visibility is a factor.

These items serve additional roles in technical diving. The lift bag may be employed as a redundant source of buoyancy control in the event of a catastrophic BCD failure. The lift bag and reel, in combination, may be used as a surface marker and possible signaling device. In situations where the diver cannot use the anchor line or other fixed line for his ascent, the lift bag and reel, again in combination, will provide an effective ascent platform for the diver as he returns towards the surface and completes his required decompression stops.

Editor's note: the eLearning manual includes an embedded link to a 1min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRke6Nc5ODk) of the deployment of an SMB/DAM.

### Surface Signals

Depending upon location and circumstances, at a minimum each diver should be equipped with both an audible and a visual surface signaling device. A simple whistle has long been the standard audible signal. For greater effectiveness, the diver might also consider one of the air-powered horn-like devices that are attached in-line on the BCD inflator hose. A brightly colored inflatable tube, sometimes referred to as a safety sausage, makes an effective visual device that is especially advantageous in rough seas. The diver also might consider a signaling mirror, or the signal flares specially intended for divers.

Surface Signals.jpg

## Other Useful Accessories

A lost or damaged dive mask may be a mere inconvenience in sport diving, but it can be a far more significant and problematic issue in technical diving. Without a mask, the diver likely will be unable to accurately read his instrumentation, and may be equally unable to decipher those required deco obligations that he so carefully recorded ahead of time on his slate. Therefore, many technical divers elect to carry a spare mask tucked away in a pocket of their BCD or dry suit.

Editor's note: The backup mask always goes in the right thigh pocket of the drysuit (with wetNotes). Justification: wetNotes and a backup mask are _emergency equipment_ and always go on the diver's right (typically the dominant side).

When diving in the open ocean, a diver often will use the boat’s anchor line for his descents and ascents. However, while trying to hang on to that line during mandatory deco stops in rough seas with a rocking boat, it may be neither accurate nor comfortable for the diver – the anchor line will be repeatedly and perhaps violently pulled up and down in response to each passing wave. In these rough conditions the diver may opt for a Jon line, which is basically a line about 3 metres or 10 feet in length with a hook-like device on one end that attaches to the anchor line, and a loop on the other end for the diver to hold. The Jon line effectively keeps the diver connected to the anchor line, yet allows him to avoid the bouncing motion as he hovers in place a short distance away.

The snorkel is a standard item in sport diving and some technical divers continue to use it on a regular basis, attached to the mask strap in the usual manner. More often, though, the typical technical diver elects to remove the snorkel from his mask. Some may simply view it as a nuisance, especially in strong currents; others, depending upon their equipment configuration and/or the diving environment, may view it as a possible entanglement hazard (including entanglement with their own regulator hose when a long hose is routed behind their head). Yet some divers are reluctant to completely abandon this potentially useful piece of equipment and instead opt for a folding snorkel stashed in a pocket, which then can be brought into service when needed.

Many divers routinely include a small dive light in their equipment package, finding it useful for looking into dark holes or under ledges. Others, such as wreck and cave divers, include a light out of necessity. For sake of redundancy, whenever a light is actually needed the diver should have a minimum of two. Some divers select a large, self-contained, lantern-style model as their primary light, with a smaller back-up light stashed in a pocket or attached to their rig. Those who frequently require a lot of light sometimes prefer the canister style; its separate battery pack can be mounted towards the rear of their BCD harness (or even mounted onto their cylinder), and its small lamp unit can then be easily hand-held or attached to the back of their hand or wrist.

The strobe is another type of light useful for the technical diver. It may be used to mark the anchor line or another ascent line in murky water, making it easier to locate. It also may be used as a personal marker in an emergency, should the diver find himself on the surface at night with his boat nowhere in sight.

A type of reel popular among some open ocean wreck divers is a Jersey up-line. It is basically comprised of a steel bar wrapped with heavy line (rope) sufficient in length to reach the surface from the diver’s maximum depth. It is an emergency ascent device, useful in strong currents where the diver is unable to make his ascent via the boat’s anchor line. In such a case, because of the current the diver would likely drift a significant distance away from the wreck (and away from his dive boat) by the time that he completes a free ascent and his mandatory deco stops. To use the Jersey up-line, the diver ties it off to the wreck and reels himself out during his ascent, so that he remains attached to the wreck and does not drift away. Once back at the surface, the diver simply cuts-away and discards the line. The ecologically-minded diver prefers to use a bio-degradable line, but this will obviously require replacement of his unused line on a regular basis. The Jersey up-line is fairly large and a bit cumbersome, so it is often attached towards the rear of the diver’s harness, or perhaps attached to his cylinders.

## Equipment Handling Options

To streamline their configuration as much as possible, some divers prefer stashing less frequently used accessories throughout the pockets of their BCD and dry suit. This always should be done with some sense of organization and consistency, so that any particular item can be readily located when needed. At the same time the actual number of items in any pocket should be limited in order to avoid confusion and help prevent the accidental loss of other items when any one item is removed.

In some cases a diver might prefer to have some larger or more frequently used accessories clipped to his BCD, or in other cases he simply may have a lack of pockets for the storage of some essential items. When items are attached haphazardly to the rig, it quickly may create a confusing mass of equipment and present potential entanglement hazards. When items are clipped to the diver’s BCD, there is still some opportunity for streamlining; for instance, rather than merely clipping a small light to a chest-high D-ring and allowing it to dangle freely, the diver can use a small length of surgical tubing to also bungee this light to his shoulder strap. Some larger items, like reels and lift bags, might be a bit more difficult to work with and often, it might be easiest to simply attach them to D-rings lower on the BCD and towards the rear, as far out of the way as possible. If additional D-rings are required, a diver might consider adding them low on the sides of his cylinders, where they will be even further back and out of his way, yet still within his reach. Whenever a diver will be forced to access one of the D-rings by feel alone (because of its location), it would be wise to limit the number of items attached at any one point, so as to avoid confusion.

When carrying an unusual abundance of accessories (as may be required for a particular dive), some divers find it useful to use a compact canvas tool bag specifically designed for this purpose This bag may be attached directly to the diver’s rig, or suspended from the rig on a short leash-like line. Similarly, some diver’s may use a tool line alone, with one end attached to their rig and several accessories clipped onto a large brass ring at the other end of this line. In some cases a diver may prefer to not enter or exit the water while carrying all of his equipment. At these times he might use an equipment line, suspended over the side of the boat. He will lower the selected equipment into the water before making his entry, and then retrieve this equipment once he’s in the water. At the end of his dive he will again remove the selected equipment and re-attach it to the line, so that he has a reduced load while climbing the boat’s ladder, and then will haul the additional equipment back on board.

The types of clips used for attaching various accessories to the rig or equipment lines may well deserve some consideration themselves. Sliding bolt clips are appropriately secure, yet easy to operate; most importantly, compared to some other types, they pose little risk of accidentally latching onto other gear or onto some entanglement hazard.

# Chapter 3: Gasses and Gas Management

## The Impact of Pressure

Pressure affects many aspects of diving. For instance every new diver learns, quite quickly, about the need to equalize one’s ears during descent. However, the effects of pressure are more far-reaching. In particular, pressure has a direct and significant impact upon the gas we breathe at depth. In order for a diver to comprehend the various concepts related to gases and gas management, it is first necessary to understand a bit about pressure.

Pressure is the force, or weight, pressing upon a person, an object, or a gas. Here at the surface, a person is exposed to the weight of the overhead atmosphere pressing downward. In the metric system, pressure is measured in bars, while in the imperial system it is measured in atmospheres (abbreviated as atm). For practical purposes, one bar is equal to one atmosphere. Thus, at the surface, the ambient (or surrounding) pressure is 1 bar or 1 atm.

During descent, the diver experiences increasing pressure caused by the added weight of the overhead water now pressing downward. For every 10 metres or 33 feet of depth in seawater, the ambient pressure increases by 1 bar or 1 atm. It’s important to remember that the weight of the water and the weight of the atmosphere both contribute to ambient pressure. The relationship of depth and ambient pressure is illustrated in the accompanying table.

Pressure Table

Next, it is important to understand how ambient pressure affects a gas. When any gas is confined within a flexible container, the pressure of that gas (pressing outward on the inside of the container) will be equal to the ambient pressure (pressing inward on the outside of the container). Any change in ambient pressure will have a direct effect upon the pressure of the gas inside the flexible container. As pressure increases, the confined gas will decrease in volume and, since its molecules then are being pressed closer together, the gas will also increase in density.

Pressure Table

These changes, in volume and density, are directly proportional to the changes in pressure. Most divers will recall a table from their entry-level training, such as the one depicted here, illustrating the important relationship between depth, pressure, volume, and density. This information is directly applicable to diving because the diver's lungs, in effect, are a large flexible container. As such, the gas pressure in the lungs will be equal to the ambient pressure. As a diver descends to depth, the pressure naturally increases inside his lungs; and when the diver returns to the surface, the pressure naturally decreases in his lungs. In addition, as a diver descends, each breath will require a greater quantity of gas to fill the diver's lungs, and the inhaled gas will become increasingly denser at depth.

## Air: The Typical Gas for Divers

By far, air remains the most widely used breathing gas in overall diving activities. Air is comprised of approximately 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen. Oxygen is a critical ingredient in the body's metabolic process, and thus it is a necessity of life. Nitrogen, on the other hand, is physiologically inert in that it is not used by the body in any manner. Though inert, a certain amount of nitrogen is routinely dissolved into the body's tissues simply because the body is exposed to it with each breath of inhaled air; the actual amount of nitrogen that will be absorbed by the tissues is dependent upon the pressure of the nitrogen.

Each component within any gas mixture accounts for a fraction of the total gas pressure. Air consists of 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen; thus, oxygen accounts for 21% of the total air pressure, and nitrogen accounts for 79% of the total air pressure. The accompanying table depicts the relationship between depth, total pressure, and the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen in air.

Pressure Table

In terms of physiology, the fraction of any gas within a breathing mixture is largely immaterial. What is important, in terms of physiology, is the pressure of each gas. As illustrated in the above table, the fractions of oxygen and nitrogen remain constant in air, yet the pressure of each gas changes according to depth. When the pressure of a gas increases, its physiological impact also increases. For a diver using air within traditional sport diving depths (up to 40 metres or 130 feet), the primary concern is the elevated pressure of nitrogen.

When the pressure of a gas increases, its physiological impact also increases. For a diver using air within traditional sport diving depths (up to 40 metres or 130 feet), the primary concern is the elevated pressure of nitrogen.

## Nitrox: An Alternate Breathing Gas

As detailed on the previous pages, a diver absorbs additional nitrogen into his tissues during a dive. On-gassing results from the diver's exposure to nitrogen at elevated pressures. In fact, nitrogen exposure is the limiting factor in determining how long a diver can safely remain underwater at a given depth, and still be able to make a direct ascent to the surface.

Is there a way to effectively reduce a diver's nitrogen exposure? Yes! The answer is enriched air nitrox or, more simply, nitrox.

Like air, nitrox is a breathing gas containing both oxygen and nitrogen; however, the percentages are different. Nitrox contains a higher percentage of oxygen than found in air, and therefore it has proportionately less nitrogen. The sole purpose in adding a higher percentage of oxygen to the mix is to replace some of the nitrogen. The oxygen itself provides no other benefit and, as will be addressed shortly, it actually introduces an additional concern.

Nitrox encompasses a wide range of oxygen-nitrogen mixtures. In order to identify the actual contents of a mixture, the abbreviation EAN is normally used (for enriched air nitrox), followed by a number that designates the percentage of oxygen it contains. Thus, a nitrox mix containing 32% oxygen would be identified as EAN32.

As the reader will recall from the prior discussion, the physiological impact of a gas is determined by its pressure. The accompanying table compares the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen in both air and EAN40.

Nitrox Pressure Table

In reviewing this table the reader should observe that while ambient pressure remains constant for a given depth, the partial pressure of each component gas now becomes a variable. As depicted in this table, the partial pressure of nitrogen with EAN40, at30 metres or 99 feet, is 2.40 bar / atm; this is approximately the same as the partial pressure of nitrogen with air, at 20 metres or 66 feet, which is 2.37 bar / atm. In effect, a diver will experience about the same nitrogen exposure with EAN40 at this deeper depth as he would with air at the shallower depth. Therefore, the significantly longer time limit for air at 20 metres or 66 feet would now apply when using EAN40 at 30 metres or 99 feet. This example clearly demonstrates the primary purpose of nitrox, which is to increase the diver's allowable bottom time at a given depth.

Naturally, to take advantage of the longer bottom times a diver must have an adequate supply of nitrox. It is important to note that the additional oxygen in the breathing mixture will have no effect on the rate at which the diver consumes the contents of his cylinder. The rate of breathing is determined not by the amount of oxygen that is inhaled, but rather by the level of carbon dioxide present in the blood.Nitrox Cylinders Carbon dioxide is a by-product of metabolism, and its output is determined by the body's workload. Under the same conditions and with the same level of physical activity, a diver's breathing rate will remain the same, regardless of whether he is breathing air or nitrox.

A diver may well find that the increase in allowable bottom time provided by nitrox now exceeds the limits of his gas supply; the diver is forced to surface not because of an approaching depth-time limit, but because he is running low on breathing gas. Even in this case, nitrox offers an advantage. Since the nitrox diver will have on-gassed less nitrogen during his dive, he will have less nitrogen to off-gas back at the surface. This means that his required surface interval between dives may be significantly reduced, and often he will be able to safely complete a greater number of dives within a given period of time.

While speaking of dive-related calculations it must be recognized that no dive table or personal dive computer can guarantee a risk-free dive in terms of decompression sickness; instead, tables and computers specify a schedule of depth-time limits that work for most of the people, most of the time, under most circumstances. With this fact in mind, there is also another possible use for nitrox. Rather than increasing allowable bottom time or reducing surface intervals, some divers prefer to use nitrox for a physiological advantage. They rationalize that by breathing nitrox while still adhering to the schedules of their air-based tables or air-based computer, they will reduce their overall nitrogen exposure during a dive and thereby lower their risk of decompression sickness.

Nitrox offers several benefits for the diver, depending upon the manner in which it is used; however, as previously noted, it also raises a new concern. Because of the increased oxygen content, the diver is now exposed to an increased partial pressure of oxygen, and there are limits to the body's tolerance for oxygen. When these tolerance limits are exceeded, there is a risk of CNS (central nervous system) oxygen toxicity, resulting in convulsions; and because a convulsing diver will likely lose his regulator, convulsions underwater often result in drowning.

According to the diving protocols established by NOAA, the maximum allowable oxygen exposure is a partial pressure of 1.6 bar / atm. Sport divers breathing air never approach anywhere near this exposure level; however, depending upon the particular nitrox mix, this exposure of 1.6 bar / atm can now be encountered at depths shallower than the traditional sport diving limit of 40 metres or 130 feet. The prior table is repeated here for ready reference. As depicted in this table, with EAN40 a diver will reach his maximum oxygen exposure at only 30 metres or 99 feet, and must never venture deeper because of the risk of CNS oxygen toxicity.

Nitrox PRessure Table

As demonstrated, because of the maximum allowable oxygen exposure, nitrox can restrict a diver's maximum depth. Further, NOAA has established time limits for all oxygen exposures from 0.5 to 1.6 bar / atm; naturally, the higher exposure levels will have significantly shorter time limits than the lower level exposures. Therefore, in some situations nitrox also might restrict a diver's allowable time at a given depth, especially with repetitive dives at the higher exposure levels. To minimize these time restrictions, some divers routinely limit their maximum exposure levels to an oxygen partial pressure of 1.4 bar / atm.

Previously, while using air the diver only needed to manage his nitrogen exposure. Now, with nitrox, the diver must manage his oxygen exposure as well. Luckily, managing the oxygen exposure is not a cumbersome process, though it adds another step to the overall dive calculations.

In the TDI Nitrox Diver course, participants learn to plan and conduct dives with nitrox mixtures from EAN22 to EAN40, using both dive tables and personal dive computers. This range of nitrox mixtures has proven to be the most versatile for general diving activities. Positioned as the entry-level program in the TDI curriculum, this course provides a solid foundation for further technical training. TDI's sport-level affiliate Scuba Diving International (SDI) offers a somewhat streamlined Computer Nitrox course, also addressing EAN22 to EAN40. The basic prerequisite, for both the TDI and SDI nitrox programs is simply an Open Water Diver certification.

The TDI Advanced Nitrox Diver course addresses nitrox mixtures beyond EAN40, up to and including 100% oxygen. These mixes have a clear application in technical diving, most often as a deco gas. During staged decompression, a diver may use a high-content nitrox mix to promote the accelerated off-gassing of nitrogen, either for physiological advantage or to reduce the time required at his deco stops.

O2 Tracking TableThough other methods exist, the most common method for creating nitrox is simply to add a calculated amount of 100% oxygen to a scuba cylinder, and then fill that cylinder the rest of the way with air. Naturally, this process should be performed only by a certified nitrox blender. There is an inherent risk of fire or explosion when dealing with 100% oxygen, and it requires special handling and equipment. Also, because 100% oxygen is introduced into the cylinder during the blending process, the cylinder itself must be specially cleaned, prepared and labeled for nitrox use.

When it comes to cleaning and preparation of regulators for nitrox use, it really depends upon the manufacturer's specifications and the chosen mix. Often the Forty Percent Rule applies if a regulator will be used with nitrox mixes of EAN40 or less. Generally, it can be used right out of the box, as delivered by the manufacturer; however, for mixtures beyond EAN40, the typical regulator must be specially cleaned and prepared by a qualified service technician prior to such use.

## Air as a Deep Diving Gas

Nitrox offers some potentially significant benefits for the diver when used within traditional sport diving depths. However, as demonstrated above, nitrox is not for deeper diving. The elevated partial pressure of oxygen at depth, associated with the oxygen-enriched nature of this breathing gas, makes nitrox unsuitable for this purpose.

For depths deeper than the traditional sport diving limits, technical divers may look back to air as their breathing mixture of choice. In fact, in terms of oxygen exposure, air theoretically may be used up to a maximum depth of 66 metres or 218 feet. However, there is another adverse effect caused by the level of nitrogen in air that impacts the diver at increasingly deeper depths; this effect is narcosis.

When a diver is exposed to elevated partial pressures of nitrogen, some of the dissolved nitrogen can begin to interfere with the electrical transmissions of the nervous system. The result is similar to intoxication. The diver may experience impaired coordination, and some diminishment in his rational thought processes. This narcotic effect is not harmful by itself; however, it can adversely affect a diver's reactions and judgment, and therein lies the potential risk.

When air is used as the breathing gas, many authorities feel that narcosis may begin at depths as shallow as about 18 metres or 60 feet; however, at such depths, the impact is largely inconsequential. Most cite 30 metres or 100 feet as the threshold depth, for the onset of noticeable symptoms. Beyond this depth, narcosis becomes increasingly debilitating. Susceptibility to narcosis will vary from diver to diver, and from day to day. Stressful situations, either physical or psychological, also contribute to the onset of symptoms; generally, a diver will be more susceptible to narcosis in cold, dark and murky water than he will be at the same depth in a warm, bright and clear tropical environment. With appropriate training and deep diving experience, a diver may learn to deal with the effects of narcosis to some extent, but nevertheless narcosis is an ever-present concern in deep diving.

Naturally, in addition to handling narcosis at deeper depths, the diver still needs to manage his nitrogen on-gassing. As the diver descends deeper, his no-decompression (no-stop) time limits will become progressively shorter. For example, the US Navy dive tables specify no-deco limits of 25 minutes at 30 metres or 100 feet, 10 minutes at 40 metres or 130 feet, and only 5 minutes at 45 metres or 150 feet. Therefore, for a deep dive of any reasonable duration, staged decompression becomes a practical necessity.

The TDI Decompression Procedures course addresses the appropriate techniques of staged decompression for dives to a maximum depth of 45 metres or 150 feet; Advanced Adventure Diver or Advanced Open Water Diver is a prerequisite for this program. The TDI Extended Range course then prepares the diver to stay even longer at these depths, and further extends the maximum depth to 55 metres or 180 feet.

## Trimix: The Gas for Deeper Diving

As just discussed, narcosis becomes a significant issue when air is used at deeper depths. Is it possible to counter this effect with something else? Yes, and the answer is trimix.

Trimix is a mixture of oxygen, helium, and nitrogen. Helium is another inert gas. Quite simply, helium is added to the breathing mix in order to replace some of the nitrogen. With a decreased level of nitrogen in the breathing gas, the narcotic effect of nitrogen similarly will be reduced.

It is important to understand that the narcotic effect of any gas is dependent upon its weight. For example, argon, which is sometimes used for dry suit inflation (because of its thermal insulating properties), is a relatively heavy gas; if inadvertently inhaled, argon will produce significant narcosis. Conversely, helium is a very light gas that produces almost no narcotic effect.

By replacing some of the nitrogen in the breathing mixture with helium, the diver will experience less narcosis. Quite simply, the diver will be able to descend to deeper depths while maintaining a clearer head.

Similar to nitrox, the term trimix encompasses a range of varying mixtures. To readily identify the specific contents of a trimix blend, a two-part numeric description is used; the first number identifies the oxygen content of the mix (expressed as a percentage of the total gas), and the second number identifies the helium content. Thus, trimix-21/30 will contain 21% oxygen and 30% helium, with nitrogen making up the balance (49%) of the total breathing gas.

Consider the following table, which compares the partial pressures of each of the component gases in air and trimix-21/30, at varying depths.

Trimix Pressure

In reviewing this table, the reader will observe that the partial pressure of nitrogen in trimix-21/30 at 60 metres or 198 feet is less than it is in air at 40 metres or 132 feet. Accordingly, it may be concluded that the diver will encounter less narcosis with this trimix blend, even at a significantly deeper depth.

The reader also should note that, with this trimix blend, the diver still will quickly approach the maximum oxygen exposure (oxygen partial pressure of 1.6 bar / atm) once he descends much deeper than the cited 60 metres or 198 feet in the above table. This trimix blend contains the same level of oxygen as found in air, and thus shares the same maximum oxygen depth of 66 metres or 218 feet. Thus, the oxygen content in this trimix blend continues to limit his depth.

For deeper depths it is also possible to replace some of the oxygen in the breathing gas with helium. A breathing mixture containing only 18% oxygen will be adequate, even at the surface, to meet the diver’s metabolic needs. Then, as the diver descends, an even lower percentage of oxygen will suffice because of its increasing partial pressure. By decreasing the level of both oxygen and nitrogen in the bottom gas, significant depths can be safely achieved. Of course, whenever using a trimix blend containing less than 18% oxygen, the diver usually will employ a higher content travel gas at intermediate depths during his descent and ascent.

In addition to reduced narcosis, helium offers another benefit for the deep technical diver. As discussed earlier in this chapter, an increase in pressure causes a gas to decrease in volume, which in turn causes an increase in its density. When gas density increases, greater effort is required for breathing, increasing the diver's overall workload. Because helium is a relatively light gas, it is also less dense; thus the increased density of helium, at depth, poses less of an issue. Trimix is easier and more comfortable for the diver to breathe at deeper depths.

As with nitrox, the benefits of trimix present a bit of a trade-off. First, because helium is a light gas, it tends to transmit heat quite readily — therefore, trimix makes a poor insulating gas for dry suit inflation (and thus argon is typically employed); even the mere act of breathing trimix can quickly whisk body heat from the diver, increasing his need for thermal protection. Second, again because it is a light gas, helium tends to be absorbed into tissues more easily than nitrogen. Trimix generally increases the time required for off-gassing during mandatory deco stops.

The TDI Helitrox course addresses the use of breathing mixtures containing at least 21% oxygen and up to 35% Helium to a maximum depth of 45 metres or 150 feet.

The TDI Trimix course addresses the use of breathing mixtures containing 18% to 21% oxygen to a maximum depth of 60 metres or 200 feet. Both Decompression Procedures/Helitrox and Advanced Nitrox are prerequisites for this program. The TDI Advanced Trimix course then extends the diver's qualifications to hypoxic mixtures (containing less than 18% oxygen) to a maximum depth of 100 metres or 330 feet.

## Effective Gas Management

In technical diving, running out of gas is simply not an option! Once committed to a decompression profile, or after venturing deep inside a wreck or cave, the technical diver no longer has the choice of making an immediate and direct ascent to the surface. Thus, with safety clearly in mind, technical divers adhere to a fundamental principle of gas management known as the Rule of Thirds. This principle dictates that no more than one-third of the diver's available gas supply is used for entering an overhead environment or otherwise venturing away from a designated starting point, another one-third is dedicated to the return trip, and the remaining one-third is held in reserve for contingencies.

It is important to note, however, that effective gas management actually begins well before a diver enters the water. As part of the dive planning process, the technical diver routinely and carefully calculates the precise amount of gas required for a particular dive; naturally these gas requirements include not only his bottom gas, but also any travel and deco gases that he intends to use. Once the actual gas requirements are determined, the diver will increase the volume by an additional 50%, providing that one-third in reserve for contingencies.

When someone asks a sport diver how long his gas supply will last at a given depth, the response all too frequently may be a blank stare. True, an experienced diver might be able to consult his log book to see how much air he had consumed on any prior similar dives, and from there he might be able to provide a rough estimate. But what if some detail is altered for the proposed dive, such as depth, cylinder volume, or overall dive conditions; would even the experienced sport diver be able to extrapolate an accurate estimate?

Rather than relying merely on rough estimates, the technical diver should be able to quickly and more accurately calculate this information. His ability to do so is based upon an understanding of his own Surface Air Consumption rate (abbreviated as SAC). The SAC is the amount of gas, measured in litres or cubic feet that he will consume per minute at the surface. Using his SAC, the technical diver will be able to readily calculate the volume of gas required for any given depth over any given period of time. Knowing one's own SAC is a critical ingredient of effective gas management.

The SAC determination begins with some baseline information obtained through a carefully conducted exercise. At the beginning of this exercise, the diver records the current reading displayed on his SPG; a digital SPG (such as the type incorporated in an air-integrated dive computer) usually will provide a more precise figure, though an analog model also may be used. The diver then swims at an average pace (consistent with his normal activity level during a typical dive), and at a constant depth, while carefully recording the elapsed time. This swim should last at least five to ten minutes, though a longer duration will likely provide more accurate data. At the end of the swim, the diver records the new reading on his SPG. He then will have the details for how much air he consumed, in terms of bars or psi (pounds per square inch), at this specific depth and over this measured period of time. To determine his SAC the diver also will need to know the rated working pressure of the cylinder used in this exercise, as well as the actual capacity of this cylinder (in litres or cubic feet) when it is filled to its working pressure. The diver then needs only to insert these figures into the following mathematical formula to calculate his SAC.

Metric:
SAC = (barUsed/workingPressure)(cylinderCapacity)/(depth/10+1)(minutes)

Imperial:
SAC = (pSIused/workingPressure)(cylinderCapacity)/(depth/33+1)(minutes)

Once the SAC is known, it is a far simpler matter to calculate the volume of gas required for any proposed dive. As the reader will recall from the introductory discussion in this chapter, an increase in pressure causes a proportional decrease in the volume of a gas. Due to this decreased volume at depth, the diver will draw proportionately more gas from his cylinder with each breath in order to fill his lungs. Thus, to calculate the volume of gas required for a particular dive, the diver merely needs to multiply his SAC by the ambient pressure at the planned depth, then again multiply that figure by the planned time at this depth. This mathematical formula is depicted below.

Volume = (SAC)(Pressure)(Time)

As noted, the above formula depends upon ambient pressure rather than depth. In order to convert depth to pressure, just remember that 1 bar / atm equals 10 metres or 33 feet of depth, and also remember that 1 bar / atm must be added for the weight of the overhead atmosphere. This depth-to-pressure conversion is illustrated in the following calculations.

Metric:
Pressure = (Depth/10)+1

Imperial:
Pressure = (Depth/33)+1

(Imperial will be slightly imprecise. Should probably be like 33.31 - Ed.)

In addition to determining his normal working SAC, the technical diver will want to know his resting SAC. This resting SAC will be applicable to his staged deco stops. He will determine this rate in a similar manner, but rather than swimming, he will use a line for reference and simply hover in place for the duration of the exercise.

The technical diver also will do well to calculate his SAC under exertion, to account for situations that require an increased activity level, such as dealing with a heavy current.

It is important to note that a number of variable factors may impact a diver's SAC. For example, equipment configuration can have a significant effect. Compared to a warm-water sport diver, the technical diver, with double cylinders and a dry suit, will encounter far greater drag while swimming. Changes in physical fitness over time, as well as a diver's recent and cumulative diving experience, may similarly influence his SAC. Thus, the SAC will vary with the circumstances, and should be recalculated accordingly.

While effective gas management begins with the calculation of gas requirements and adherence to the Rule of Thirds, it certainly doesn't end there. As a further step in gas management, the conscientious technical diver will break down his overall planned dive into a series of smaller segments, with a portion of his gas supply allotted to each segment. In effect, he'll define a progression of way-points during his dive; he will then identify how much gas he plans to use up to each way-point, and how much gas he should have remaining at each way-point. These details then will be transferred to his slate, and carried with him underwater. Periodically throughout the dive, he'll reference this information, to ensure that his actual gas consumption remains in line with the planned parameters. In this manner he will be able to detect any potential problem early in the dive and alter his dive accordingly, rather than discovering an unexpected shortage of gas after it's too late.

For the sake of simplicity, the above discussion has focused upon the diver using a single gas throughout his dive. In fact, gas selection is an important ingredient in the planning process. The technical diver often will opt for multiple gas mixtures on a single dive, with different mixtures being matched to appropriate segments of that dive. The calculations, outlined above, will then encompass each of the diver's chosen gases.

As noted, the calculated gas requirements should include the appropriate reserve for contingencies. The diver must ensure that he has sufficient gas, in case he inadvertently exceeds his planned depth or time and incurs a longer deco obligation. When planning to use a deco mix, he also should consider the additional volume of bottom gas that would be required to complete all deco stops in the event that his deco gas is lost.

Though effective gas management is critical in technical diving, it must be noted that it can be similarly beneficial to the sport diver as well. Unlike many of the other topics in this course, these techniques can be readily adopted by the reader and applied in personal diving activities without further prerequisite training.

# Chapter 4: Technical Diving Activities

- Topics Covered in this Chapter:
- General Procedures
- Staged Decompression
- Overhead Environments
- Rebreather Diving
- Solo Diving
- Contingency Procedures
- Review Questions

As noted in the opening chapter of this manual, the hallmark of technical diving is precise dive planning and execution.

Dive planning starts long before the actual dive. The team members first agree upon the objective and other specific details of the proposed dive. Each buddy then completes his own detailed dive plan, including gas selection, deco schedules, and gas requirement calculations.

Immediately prior to each dive, technical divers typically conduct a detailed team briefing. This includes a thorough review of the dive objective and previously developed dive plan. Gas selection and gas requirements are evaluated again. All required in-water tasks are assigned to specific team members. Hand signals are reviewed and agreed upon. Contingencies are addressed. Finally, before every dive, a comprehensive pre-dive equipment safety check is performed.

The pre-dive safety check does not end at the surface. Once in the water and before venturing too far into their descent, technical divers conduct an additional safety inspection. This first includes a bubble check; each diver makes a careful observation of his buddy, to make sure that there are no bubbles leaking from the cylinders, valves, manifold, regulators, BCD, or dry suit. This is followed by a head-to-toe visual inspection, looking for any equipment that might have been dislodged or displaced during entry, and to identify any potential entanglement issues. The proper functioning of all instrumentation is verified. Underwater lights are tested. Finally, whenever appropriate, air sharing techniques may be briefly rehearsed.

During the dive itself, several governing principles apply. First, the plan always takes precedence over the objective; planned time and depth limits are strictly observed, even if it means relegating the objective to a subsequent dive. Second, absolutely nothing takes precedence over diver safety. Third, if something seems wrong, it is wrong; the planned contingency response will be implemented immediately, without hesitation. Fourth, any team member can turn or end the dive at any time, for any reason, without question.

As suggested by the above routine, technical diving dictates an appropriate level of personal maturity and self-discipline in the diver.

## Staged Decompression

Sport diving is defined as no-decompression (or no-stop) diving. During prior diver training programs, the reader undoubtedly was cautioned on multiple occasions that decompression always should be avoided. Unfortunately, all too frequently the sport diving discussion of deco abruptly ends at that point. As a result, the student may be left with an erroneous impression that there is something inherently wrong with deco. In fact, the addition of a single caveat would provide the appropriate clarification, in that decompression diving should be avoided ". . .without additional training."

Decompression diving generally has been excluded from the streamlined curriculum of sport diving; the additional training for decompression diving is provided at the technical level.

Interestingly, a number of authorities opine that this distinction between deco and no-deco is somewhat of a fallacy, in that all diving is decompression diving. The diver always experiences nitrogen on-gassing upon descent due to increasing pressure, or compression. The diver always experiences nitrogen off-gassing upon ascent due to decreasing pressure, or decompression. The extent of on-gassing is dependent upon the depth and duration of the dive, and it is the first critical factor in the subsequent off-gassing process that occurs during decompression. The second critical factor in off-gassing is the rate of decompression, or the rate of the diver's ascent. After every dive, the only consideration is whether the diver will be able to proceed directly to the surface during his ascent, or if it will be necessary to further slow his ascent (with one or more interim stops during that ascent) before surfacing.

The sport diver relies upon the depth-time schedules provided by his dive tables or personal dive computer. He adheres to a schedule that allows him to make a slow but direct ascent to the surface at the end of his dive. For conservatism, during the ascent he might include a safety stop (typically about 3 minutes, at about 4.5 metres or 15 feet), which is basically a precautionary deco stop, especially if his dive was relatively deep or came close to the no-deco limit.

The technical diver also relies upon the depth-time schedules provided by his dive tables or personal dive computer. Rather than adhering to a single no-deco schedule, he now has access to an expanded series of schedules. During his ascent, he makes one or more staged stops, as indicated by his tables or computer, based upon his actual depth-time profile. He also may add some conservatism, by extending the time spent at the shallower stops.

As an example, the US Navy dive tables provide the following decompression schedules for a dive to 42 metres or 140 feet, with air used as the breathing gas.

| Depth  | Bottom Time (min) | 40 ft (12.1 m) | 30 ft (9.1 m) | 20 ft (6.0 m) | 10 ft (3.0 m) | Repetitive Group |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 140 ft | 10                |                |               |               | 0             | E                |
|        | 15                |                |               |               | 2             | H                |
|        | 20                |                |               |               | 7             | J                |
|        | 25                |                |               |               | 26            | L                |
|        | 30                |                |               |               | 44            | N                |
|        | 35                |                |               | 4             | 59            | O                |
|        | 40                |                |               | 11            | 80            | Z                |
|        | 45                |                | 3             | 21            | 113           | Z                |
|        | 50                |                | 7             | 28            | 145           | Z                |
|        | 55                |                | 16            | 28            | 171           | Z                |

As the reader will note, for a dive of 10 minutes or less, no stop is required during the ascent. For a dive of 20 minutes, a single stop is required at 3 metres or 10 feet, for at least 7 minutes. For a dive of 55 minutes, stops are required at 9.1 metres or 30 feet for 16 minutes, at 6 metres or 20 feet for 28 minutes, and at 3 metres or 10 feet for 171 minutes.

As usual, the repetitive group at the end of the dive is used in determining surface interval credit and calculating the residual nitrogen time for a subsequent dive.

The above schedules apply only when the diver is using air as both the bottom gas and deco gas. Naturally, alternate decompression schedules will be required when a dive is conducted with nitrox or trimix. Published tables are available from various sources. In addition, the technical diver may use PC-based decompression software to create custom tables in accordance with personal preferences and specific gas selections, including the use of auxiliary travel and deco gases.

Published dive tables often are provided in a waterproof design, so that they may be taken along on a dive. However with their multiple deco schedules and relatively small print, some technical divers feel that their use underwater, during the stress of a dive, may too easily lead to confusion and error. Instead, for ready reference the diver will copy the relevant information onto a slate, which is worn on his wrist or carried in a pocket. Most often he will include the actual schedule for his planned depth and planned time, as well as contingency schedules for the next deeper depth and next longer time.

Each required deco stop must be performed at the specified depth, as any variation in depth can affect the off-gassing process. Therefore, the technical diver often will employ a visual and/or tactile reference, such as an anchor or ascent line, to assist in accurately maintaining his depth; when no other reference is available, the diver may deploy his lift-bag and reel for this purpose. A diver should basically be at rest while completing his stops. Some light movement is acceptable while hovering, but prolonged strenuous activity should be avoided as it may adversely impact the off-gassing process.

The TDI Decompression Procedures course provides appropriate training in the basic tools and techniques of staged decompression; the prerequisite for this program is a sport-level Advanced Adventure Diver or Advanced Open Water Diver certification. The deco material is complemented by the TDI Advanced Nitrox Diver course, and the knowledge and skills are expanded upon in the TDI Extended Range and Trimix Diver courses.

## Overhead Environments

Like deco, sport divers are frequently cautioned that they should avoid diving in any overhead environment. Again, the same caveat appropriately applies, in that it should be avoided ". . .without additional training."

Overhead environments encompass three separate types of technical activities, wreck penetration, mine penetration and cave diving. These activities are quite similar in some respects. In both cases, there is a very real barrier precluding an immediate vertical ascent towards the surface. Each can present a navigational maze of twisting and turning passageways, which at times might also be quite narrow. There normally is no ambient light, beyond the immediate area of the opening. And there is always the very real possibility of a sudden silt-out, totally obscuring visibility.

Along with the similarities, noted above, there are some distinct differences. Cave formations are generally quite stable over time. Wrecks can change rather quickly due to deterioration of the metal structure, as well as battering by waves and surge. The power of the sea is significant; in recent years, the mere glancing blows of two passing hurricanes dramatically altered a couple of popular wrecks in the Upper Florida Keys, despite the fact that they are located at depths greater than 30 metres or 100 feet. Entanglement hazards also tend to be more prevalent in wreck diving, posed by abandoned fishing lines and nets and by the wreck's own cables and wires. Mine diving can have some of the features of both wreck and cave diving.

A diver usually will be able to avoid entanglement simply by staying alert to his surroundings. If an entanglement does occur, it is important that the diver immediately stop all movement; any attempt to turn around quickly to look, or any thrashing about, might further entangle the diver. Often, if the diver swam into the entanglement, he will be able to simply back out of it. If that proves unsuccessful, the diver should carefully look around, to see if he can locate the actual snag and free it by hand. Otherwise, unless the diver's buddy can remedy the situation, the diver usually will need to cut himself free. In the worst case, when the entanglement occurs behind the diver and involves his hoses, first stage, or cylinder valve, it might be necessary for the diver to remove his scuba unit in order to free himself from the entanglement.

In comparing the two environments, some may argue that the interior of a cave is random in its layout, while a wreck has well defined compartments and passageways. However, deterioration and collapse, as well as marine growth, may quickly obscure the visual references inside a wreck. Even in those situations where the structure remains relatively intact, it can be quite confusing when the wreck is lying on its side, or when it is upside down. In any case and in either environment, a silt-out or light failure will prevent the diver from relying solely upon visual navigational cues. The greatest risk in both wreck penetration and cave diving is the danger of a diver becoming lost and trapped inside due to disorientation.

Wreck and cave divers use a reel to lay a line as both a visual and a tactile navigational reference. First, the line is secured just outside the opening into the wreck or cave; then, as the divers enter, the line is secured again immediately inside the opening. The buddy with the reel leads the team. He deploys the line as he proceeds, keeping it low and to one side of the divers' path. Care is needed in deploying this line, so that the line itself does not pose an entanglement hazard for the divers. As they proceed, it often will be necessary to secure the line at additional points along the route, in order to maintain its proper positioning. If the divers elect to venture away from the primary navigational line, they will use a smaller reel to lay a secondary line. When it comes time to turn and exit, the other team members proceed first along the line, while the buddy with the reel is now re-positioned at the rear of the team and he retrieves the line during their return.

Reel Placement
Reels can be rather challenging at times to use. Proper tension must be applied to the line during both deployment and retrieval, to avoid having the line hopelessly tangle around the reel. The line must be attached at the opening, and along the route, in a manner that keeps it secure during use yet also allows for it later to be readily unfastened after use. Proper deployment and retrieval takes time, which may be a significant consideration in pre-dive planning and during the dive itself. Skilled use of a reel requires a lot of practice under favorable conditions.

Naturally, wreck and cave divers require a lot of light. A large lantern-style light often will be adequate, but serious wreck and cave divers usually opt for the higher power of canister-style lights, with the battery pack mounted towards the rear of their harness, and the smaller light unit either handheld or attached to their wrist, to the back of their hand, or to their reel. Of course, wreck and cave divers also will be equipped with multiple back-up lights.

However, even the most powerful light will be of little use in a silt-out; visibility may be reduced to zero and the suspended particles in the water will deflect the beam directly back toward the diver. Silt is ever present on the floors of wrecks and caves, and may be easily stirred by diver contact or by a diver's fin kicks. Thus, proper buoyancy control is always a critical issue, and special finning techniques are employed by both wreck and cave divers. The wreck diver encounters an additional source of silt-out, in that the walls and ceilings of a wreck are often covered with particles of rust. These particles may be easily dislodged by contact or finning, and also by the diver's exhaust bubbles. Once visibility is diminished by silt, it will not quickly improve; generally there is little current inside a wreck or cave to help clear the silt from the water. In the event of a silt-out, the divers will need to use the previously laid line from their reel as a tactile reference to find their way out.

Separate training programs are offered for wreck penetration, mine penetration and cave diving, with each addressing the skills and techniques for that particular environment. The TDI Advanced Wreck Diver course builds upon the prior prerequisite training of the sport-level Wreck Diver Specialty course. Advanced Adventure Diver or Advanced Open Water Diver is an additional prerequisite. The TDI Cavern Diver course is the entry-level program for caves, and is exclusively conducted within the ambient light zone of a cave opening (similar to the limited penetration in the sport-level wreck specialty); the training then continues with the TDI Introductory Cave Diver and Full Cave Diver courses. TDI Mine Diver Level I is an introduction to the basic principles of mine diving utilizing a single primary guide line. This continues on to Mine Diver Level II where emphasis is placed upon dive planning and skill perfection through actual mine penetration.

## Rebreather Diving

Up to this point the discussion has focused upon diving with the traditional open circuit scuba system. With this system the diver draws a fresh supply of gas from his cylinder for each inhaled breath, and then his exhaled breath is simply expelled into the surrounding water through the exhaust port of the regulator. The advantage of open circuit scuba is the simplicity of its design. Its disadvantage is that the diver must carry a large volume of breathing gas.

The rebreather is a closed circuit or semi-closed circuit scuba system. The diver's exhaled breath actually contains a significant amount of unused oxygen; rather than discarding this exhaled gas, a rebreather captures it for recycling. Carbon dioxide, which is a by-product of metabolism, is first removed from the exhaled gas by passing it through an absorbent filtering agent. The gas is then replenished by injecting a small quantity of oxygen or high-content nitrox into the gas. Finally, the recycled mixture is returned again to the diver for breathing. The advantage of a rebreather is the efficiency of gas usage, which thereby allows the diver to carry a much smaller volume of pressurized gas. Its disadvantage is the complexity of the recycling process, which necessitates far greater care and maintenance by the diver.

A rebreather provides several practical benefits for the technical diver. First, it is significantly lighter in weight than a set of double cylinders, making topside equipment handling a bit easier. Second, because of its increased efficiency in gas usage, a rebreather often will accommodate multiple dives, and perhaps an entire day's worth of diving, without the need to change cylinders. Third, there are little or no exhaust bubbles; thus, the rebreather is much quieter, often enabling a diver to get closer to skittish marine creatures for photos and video, and the lack of bubbles also may be beneficial while diving in some overhead environments.

As noted, rebreathers come in two varieties for diving — an individual model may be either a closed circuit rebreather (abbreviated as CCR), or a semi-closed circuit rebreather (abbreviated as SCR).

The SCR is the less complex system, in that it tends to be purely mechanical in design. It is normally equipped with a small cylinder of nitrox (usually EAN40 to EAN60), which supplies a very slow but constant flow of replenishing gas into the breathing mixture. This constant in-flow of nitrox naturally requires that a similarly small quantity of gas be routinely vented from the breathing circuit, though the quantity of bubbles is greatly reduced compared to open circuit gear. The rate of flow for the nitrox is dependent upon the size of the injector orifice. The fraction of oxygen in the breathing mix is controlled by a combination of the selected orifice and the chosen nitrox blend. With an SCR, the fraction of oxygen remains constant throughout the dive; in this regard, it is similar to a diver breathing air or pre-mixed nitrox through an open circuit scuba system.

The CCR is the more complex system, as it tends to rely upon internal sensors coupled with electronic controls to constantly blend and adjust the breathing mixture. It is usually equipped with two small cylinders — one contains oxygen or a high-content nitrox blend; the other contains a diluent gas, such as air, which is used when appropriate to lower the oxygen level in the breathing mix. The CCR provides a constant partial pressure of oxygen at depth (rather than a constant fraction of oxygen). The actual mixture varies throughout the dive, in order to provide an optimal breathing mixture for the diver; in effect, the CCR will alternately deliver a bottom gas, a travel gas, or a deco gas mixture. In addition to nitrox, some CCR units also accommodate trimix.

Beyond these general features, the design and function of individual rebreather units can differ widely. Operating procedures are somewhat unique to each model. Each also has its own specific protocols for care and maintenance, as established by the manufacturer for that particular unit. Accordingly, rather than a single training program, TDI offers a comprehensive curriculum of unit-specific Closed Circuit Rebreather and Semi-Closed Circuit Rebreather courses. The prerequisites include Nitrox Diver for all of the SCR programs, and Advanced Nitrox Diver for the basic CCR programs.

## Solo Diving

Once again, sport divers have been frequently cautioned that they should never venture into the water alone; here, as well, the very same caveat is appropriate, “. . .without additional training.”

Solo Diver
True, diving is viewed by many as a social activity. These divers sincerely enjoy sharing the experience as they explore the marine life around a tropical reef, or as they survey the structure and ponder the mystery of a newly discovered wreck. They also often deem it handy to have a buddy nearby to help while donning gear, as well as to provide assistance in an underwater emergency.

Nevertheless, some divers choose to dive alone. Solo diving mandates a high degree of self-sufficiency. The diver must be prepared, in terms of equipment, personal skills, and mindset, to effectively deal with any reasonably foreseeable contingency that might arise during a dive. These are the same considerations as previously discussed in relation to overall technical diving, but they carry an added degree of importance when it comes to diving solo.

It must be pointed out that solo diving may not be appropriate in combination with some other technical endeavors. In particular, even the most experienced diver likely will find a buddy advantageous while engaging in deep or decompression diving, or when venturing inside a wreck or cave. However, within reasonable depths and under favorable conditions and with the proper training and equipment, going solo may be a valid choice.

In many respects, the training is similar to other types of technical diving. An emphasis is placed upon appropriate equipment selection, including redundancy for the diver’s breathing gas. Additional topics include dive planning and execution, underwater navigation, and emergency management. The overall goal is developing self-reliance and self-sufficiency in the diver.

It is important to note that these attributes, self-reliance and self-sufficiency, are not reserved exclusively for the solo diver. This level of skill and competence should be the aspiration of every diver. It makes an individual both a better diver and a better dive buddy. In this respect, solo training will prove beneficial even for the diver who never intends to dive alone.

The Solo Diver course is offered through TDI’s affiliate, SDI (Scuba Diving International). SDI was the first internationally recognized training organization to offer a solo certification. The prerequisites for this course include an Advanced Sport Diver certification plus 100 logged dives.

## Contingency Procedures

Regardless of how carefully a dive is planned or how conscientiously those pre-dive safety checks are performed, sooner or later something inevitably will go wrong during a dive. The source of the problem may well be a sudden equipment malfunction, though more commonly the underlying cause will involve some type of diver error. In fact, under close scrutiny, the root of many common equipment problems can be traced to lax attention to routine care and maintenance on the part of the diver. In any event and as previously stated, the technical diver must be prepared, in terms of equipment, personal skills, and mindset, to effectively deal with any reasonably foreseeable contingency that might arise during a dive.

By way of preparation, the diver tries to envision the specific things that can go wrong. Naturally, he should reflect on his own past experience, and also should welcome any insights that might be provided by other divers. For each potential problem he then will identify an appropriate and precise response.

It has been said that a person's reaction time in any emergency situation will increase exponentially according to the number of options available to him. If the person has only one choice, he will be able to react quickly. But if that same person happens to have two choices, it actually might take him four times as long to react, because he'll first need to weigh his options and decide what to do.

In terms of contingency planning, the diver should identify the best single response to a specific problem, and adopt that as his sole planned response. Practice always improves performance, so the diver should next rehearse his planned response during a simulated in-water emergency scenario as often as necessary until it becomes instinctive. During this practice he'll readily discover any difficulty, and will be able to modify his plan accordingly. Then, as part of his routine pre-dive preparation, the diver also should visualize and mentally rehearse his planned response to each foreseeable contingency.

On occasion, a reader might wonder whether it still wouldn't be better to have multiple responses for a specific contingency. The simple answer is "no." What if the first response doesn't work? Well, in effect that is another separate contingency and should be dealt with accordingly. The diver must focus on one contingency at a time in order to develop a single well-honed response to each contingency.

Following is a list of some reasonably foreseeable contingencies for the reader to consider. An appropriate response to each, in one form or another, already has been suggested during the earlier discussions in this course:

- Lost or damaged mask
- Regulator malfunction
- Entanglement
- Accidentally exceeding planned depth or time
- Light failure
- BC inflator malfunction
- Shortage of primary (bottom) gas
- Loss of decompression gas
- Unable to locate ascent line
- Silt-out inside a wreck or cave

What other contingencies might arise? The first that comes to mind involves a non-responsive buddy; here the diver should turn to those procedures outlined in first aid, CPR, and rescue diver training. Of course, other contingencies also exist, and these are further explored in the technical diver courses related to each specialty area.
