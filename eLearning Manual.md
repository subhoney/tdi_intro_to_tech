## Welcome to the TDI Introduction to Tech course

TDI is Technical Diving International, the largest and most widely recognized technical diver training organization worldwide. We are committed to offering the highest quality programs, supported by the latest materials, with the most up to date practical information and innovative techniques. Our instructors are held to the highest standards to ensure quality training in all TDI programs conducted worldwide.

In the past, many sport divers were unnecessarily intimidated by technical diving, and thus were reluctant to explore this advanced aspect of recreational diving. Some may have been puzzled by the apparently alien equipment. Others might have had a concern about venturing beyond the traditional sport diving boundaries. Many really didn’t understand what technical diving is all about; a few didn’t even know it existed. At the time there was no single resource geared towards the sport diver that provided an appropriate overview of technical diving.

Intro to Tech is a relatively new addition to the TDI training curriculum, first introduced in 2007. The purpose of this manual, and this course, is to introduce the sport diver to the concepts of technical diving. It focuses primarily on defining the various activities, explaining the equipment, outlining the options, and previewing the information that will be further addressed during formal training in each specialty area. Along the way it will dispel some myths and explore relevant topics. It is not intended, by itself, to make you a full-fledged technical diver; instead, it will help lay a foundation for subsequent technical training, while also enabling you to make informed decisions about your own training path.

We trust that you will find this program both informative and beneficial.

## Some Basic Terminology

As recognized by most authorities, both inside and outside the dive industry, there are three distinct categories of diving: recreational, commercial, and scientific. Recreational diving is a hobby-type activity in which participation is based upon personal enjoyment, while both commercial and scientific diving conversely are vocational pursuits. Naturally, each category of diving is subject to its own protocols and participant qualifications.

Even within the dive industry, some have misconstrued the term recreational diving as applying only to a specific and limited range of sport diving activities, and have mistakenly labeled technical diving as something other than recreational diving. In fact, technical diving is an advanced form of recreational diving. Thus, throughout this text the term sport diving will be used to identify the more traditional aspects of recreational diving, and thereby segregate such activities from the advanced practices and procedures of technical diving.

## Key Contrasts: Technical vs. Sport Diving

As will be readily apparent to most readers, sport diving represents the majority of overall recreational diving activities. Sport diving is widely enjoyed by many participants, often in warm and exotic locations, typically using a relatively simple equipment kit and often requiring only basic entry-level training. Yes, there are advanced sport dives that require some additional training and perhaps a little extra equipment, but for many participants, these advanced activities represent the exception rather than the norm in their diving routine. Most new divers consider their entry level training to have been quite comprehensive, but in actuality, this initial curriculum is streamlined to present only information that is deemed essential; and essential is often defined in terms of the diving activities and environments to which the average sport diver will most likely be exposed.

There is a clear consensus among certification agencies concerning the scope of sport diving; in fact, sport diving is most often identified by its well-established parameters and limitations. The standard scuba unit for sport divers is open circuit scuba with a single cylinder. Novice divers are usually restricted to a depth of 20 metres or 60 feet, while the maximum depth limit for all sport diving is frequently cited as 40 metres or 130 feet. Sport divers are cautioned that they should always avoid entering any overhead environment. Most significantly, sport diving is exclusively no-decompression (or no-stop) diving. The governing principle in sport diving is that the participant will be able to make a direct ascent to the surface at any time.

Conversely, technical diving often is characterized by the fact that it involves activities and environments that are beyond the boundaries of traditional sport diving. It might include staged decompression, alternate breathing gases, or penetration into the dark recesses of wrecks and caves. No, technical divers are not mere renegades who disregard the traditional rules. Technical diving truly is a discipline unto itself. It combines appropriate education, experience, and equipment to enable its practitioners to soundly and safely engage in these types of advanced diving activities.

As will be easily appreciated by the reader, when applied to technical diving, the term essential now encompasses a significantly broader base of knowledge and skills.

By its very nature, technical diving frequently requires additional and/or specialized equipment, far exceeding the traditional scuba unit used by the sport diver. A technical diver usually will stand out from the crowd on a boat shared with sport divers, simply because of his equipment. However, the equipment by itself does not necessarily make a technical diver; this equipment is simply a means to an end, allowing the tech diver to participate in these advanced diving activities.

A sport diver may have the luxury of adopting a rather casual approach to routine diving. With a little experience under his belt, he might be able to gear up and jump into the water with only minimal thought. He may have a loosely-defined route in mind, or perhaps just intends to wander around for a while underwater. Then he'll simply end his dive and surface when . . .

. . . his dive computer suggests an approaching NDL; or
. . . he is beginning to run low on air in his cylinder; or
. . . it's almost time for his dive boat to depart this site; or
. . . he encounters some type of unexpected problem.

The hallmark of technical diving is precise dive planning and execution. Critical components of the planning process include a well-defined route and objective, depth-time considerations and deco obligations, gas selection and effective gas management, and contingency issues. Nothing is routinely left to happenstance. Many technical dives involve staged decompression and, as succinctly noted in the NOAA Diving Manual (4th edition, 2001), "there is no such thing as a casual decompression dive."

Rightly or wrongly, advanced training sometimes might be viewed as optional for the sport diver; however, it is unquestionably a prerequisite in technical diving. Diver safety is the critical factor. Technical diving is not the place for random trial-and-error experimentation by an uninformed amateur, because often there is simply less margin for error. After venturing deep into an overhead environment, or once committed to a decompression profile, the diver will no longer have the option of a direct ascent to the surface. The technical diver must be fully prepared, in terms of equipment, personal skills, and mindset, to effectively deal with any reasonably foreseeable contingency that might arise during a dive.

Technical diving places a heavy emphasis on self-sufficiency, yet at the same time mandates a well-organized and mission-oriented team approach. Close coordination is required among the members of a dive team in terms of gas matching, profile matching, and experience matching. Depending upon the requirements for a particular dive, the members of the team also might extend beyond the primary divers to include additional in-water safety divers and surface support personnel.

## A Bit of History

Modern scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) was invented by Emile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1943. Some earlier systems certainly existed, but left much to be desired. As a French naval officer, Cousteau himself had experienced the dire shortcomings of more primitive underwater equipment. Following deployment by Allied forces in the latter days of World War II, scuba came home to the civilian world with some of the returning veterans.

In the earliest days of recreational diving, the typical dive instructor most frequently was an ex-military diver, and the early civilian training programs naturally mimicked the military regimens. It was not unusual, at that time, for recreational diver training to be extraordinarily lengthy and detailed, as well as physically demanding. Training tended to be all-inclusive, encompassing the full spectrum of all possible diving activities, and routinely addressing a number of now-obscure diving concepts; in particular, decompression diving was a standard part of the training. Consistent with its military heritage and philosophy, diving at that time was not intended for the average person. Clearly the extensive prerequisite training served as a barrier for many, and active participation was effectively limited to the select few who could measure up to those standards.

However, it was soon recognized that sport diving actually could be something quite different than military diving, and therefore the training could be treated accordingly.

Los Angeles County was home to the first civilian diver training organization in the USA in 1954, and by the mid 1960s several other certification agencies had appeared, all under the new banner of recreational diving. A primary goal was standardization and sanctioning of sport diver training. Anxious to attract wider participation, yet with a vigilant eye toward safety, ongoing efforts have been made to dramatically streamline entry-level training while simultaneously narrowing the types of activities deemed appropriate for sport divers. In the process, sport diving evolved into the avocation that we know today, with its standardized training requirements and its well-defined parameters and limitations.

Undoubtedly, during the ensuing years, a few participants felt unnecessarily constrained by the boundaries of sport diving. Some of these individuals started to look elsewhere for tools and techniques that would help expand the range of their personal diving activities. Their focus was turned back toward military diving protocols, as well as forward toward the more recent developments in commercial and scientific diving.

The term technical diving was coined by AquaCorps magazine in 1991 to identify certain advanced diving activities that were clearly outside the mainstream of recreational diving. Though the label itself was new, in fact technical diving already had been around for a number of years, and was continuing to grow in popularity.

An initial focus of early technical divers was nitrox, an alternate breathing mixture for air, whose value already had been demonstrated in the military and scientific diving arenas. Specialized training organizations first offered nitrox training to sport divers in 1985, using materials from NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Initially nitrox was shunned within the recreational diving community, and as recently as 1991 these specialized training organizations were actually banned from a major dive industry event. Of course, since that time, nitrox has gained far wider acceptance, and by 1995 nitrox effectively had made the leap from the technical realm into mainstream sport diving. Today most sport diver training agencies have established their own nitrox diving programs.

In the meantime, those early specialized organizations continued to expand into other areas of advanced diving tools and techniques, and eventually evolved into today’s technical diver training organizations. In particular, TDI can trace its roots directly back to those early nitrox pioneers, and TDI is now recognized as the world’s largest and most innovative technical agency. The current TDI curriculum includes certification courses in Nitrox and Advanced Nitrox, Decompression Procedures and Extended Range Diving, Trimix and Advanced Trimix, Closed Circuit and Semi-Closed Circuit Rebreathers, Advanced Wreck Diving, Cavern and Cave Diving.

Slowly but surely technical diving has gained wider acceptance, and it seems that tech is now the "hot" dive industry buzzword. At recent trade shows (where even nitrox was once unspoken), almost every major manufacturer is promoting some new item of technical gear. Perhaps the most significant indication of the acceptance of tech is the fact that some of the old sport-only training agencies now are starting to dabble with their own version of a technical curriculum.

## Commonalities in Recreactional Diving

First and foremost, diving is diving, whether it is sport or technical in nature. The same principles of physics and physiology apply in each case. Much of the equipment is the same, or at least similar in function and use. Every recreational diver appropriately begins his or her training with the Open Water Diver course. Technical training is an extension of sport diving, building upon that foundation provided by each diver’s prior training and experience.

Some sport diver programs effectively serve as preparatory introductions to technical training; for example, the sport-level Wreck Diver specialty is a prerequisite for the TDI Advanced Wreck Diver course.

Some sport diver skills are directly transferable to technical diving. In order to use a dry suit for technical dives, a diver relies upon the sport-level SDI Dry Suit Diver specialty for appropriate training. The skills learned in the SDI Underwater Navigation Specialty course are equally applicable to both sport and technical dives. The sport-level SDI Rescue Diver training is highly recommended for all divers, regardless of their interests or activities.

Both sport and technical diving have a progressive curriculum of continuing education, yet each also offers a variety of programs that allow individual divers to tailor their training to match their personal interests. Looking at it another way, sport and technical are simply catch-phrases that help to characterize and differentiate general types of underwater activities within the broader category of recreational diving.

## Personal Considerations

Is technical diving for you? That’s a personal and very individual decision because, quite candidly, it is not right for everyone. Your TDI instructor can and will assist you in evaluating whether you’re ready, based upon your past training and experience. In fact, some instructors routinely conduct a counseling session with each student prior to enrolling in a technical course, to address these specific issues. Assuming that prerequisites have been fulfilled, the ultimate question then becomes whether technical diving is something that you really want to try.

Gliding along a shallow reef in warm tropical waters is definitely an enjoyable experience. For some recreational divers, this is all they ever seek to do, and they have no interest in going further. They are sport divers by choice. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that!

Maybe you want to stay a little longer than allowed by traditional sport diving limits, or go a little deeper, or take a peek inside that wreck or cave. You have the desire to safely and soundly extend your diving beyond the realm of the average recreational diver. And you are prepared to make the necessary investment in terms of training and equipment. Then you’re likely a candidate for technical training.

Perhaps you just want to know more about diving in general, such as how the laws of physics affect your body while underwater, and how you can properly deal with those effects. Yes, technical training addresses such issues in far greater detail. But maybe you’re not quite sure how far you want to go in technical diving. That’s fine! There’s a range of technical programs that allow you to tailor your training to match your personal interests.

Maybe you still enjoy those shallow tropical reefs. No problem! You do not need to abandon all sport diving activities once you become a technical diver. Most technical divers still enjoy, quite thoroughly, that casual spin around the reef. Technical diving is simply an extension of their other recreational diving activities.

Clearly, the advanced knowledge and skills gained through technical training will help the participant become a more comfortable, capable, and confident diver overall.

## General Equipment Issues

Equipment configuration may be one of the most obvious characteristics that visually distinguish the technical diver from the traditional sport diver.

Actually, the basic technical set-up shares much in common with its sport diving equivalent. Both consist of four key components: (1) a pressurized supply of breathing gas; (2) a regulator system to deliver the gas to the diver; (3) a BC to carry the gas cylinders and also to provide complete buoyancy control; and (4) instrumentation to monitor all vital information related to depth, time, and gas supply. However there also are some significant differences, between the sport and technical set-ups, as will be addressed in this chapter.

In addition to the basic set-up, the standard equipment unit for technical diving frequently includes other items and accessories that may be a bit alien to the sport diver.

In terms of equipment selection and configuration, the seasoned technical diver is governed by two key principles. First, he ensures that he has the proper equipment for a particular dive, including redundancy of all critical equipment. Second, he seeks to streamline his overall equipment configuration through careful arrangement of required components, and also by eliminating any accessory items that are unnecessary for a particular dive.

## Primary Cylinders

Air is everything! In selecting equipment for a planned dive, the technical diver’s first concern will be his supply of breathing gas, based upon the requirements for a particular dive, as well as a suitable reserve for contingencies. Technical diving may involve extended bottom times, perhaps at relatively deep depths, with additional time spent underwater during mandatory decompression stops. Sometimes a diver will be able to meet his gas supply requirements with a single high-capacity cylinder, though more frequently he will opt for double cylinders. In addition to volume, double cylinders offer an advantage to the technical diver in terms of redundancy.

The preferred and most effective method for using double cylinders is to join them together into a single unit with an isolation manifold. This configuration allows for two separate (redundant) first stage regulators to be used, with one first stage attached to the outlet valve on each side of the manifold. With the isolation valve open, each regulator is able to deliver gas to the diver from both cylinders.

Manifold.jpg

In the event of a regulator failure resulting in a free-flow, the diver can readily reach back and shut down the outlet valve for the affected regulator. By doing so, the wasteful discharge of gas can be eliminated. Then, even with that one regulator shut down, the diver still will be able to draw upon the contents of both cylinders through his remaining regulator.

Isolate Manifold.jpg

Though fairly rare, it is also possible to experience a catastrophic loss of gas due to a cylinder or valve failure. Such a situation might involve a ruptured neck o-ring (where the valve attaches into the cylinder), or a ruptured burst disk (pressure-relief mechanism, located in the body of a valve between the cylinder and the valve’s internal mechanism). In this case there is nothing a diver can do underwater to shut down the actual leak; however, the diver can segregate the offending o-ring or burst disk by closing the manifold’s isolation valve, thus limiting the loss of gas to the affected side, while preserving the gas in his remaining cylinder.

Isolate Manifold.jpg

An alternate approach involves the use of independent double cylinders, banded together on the diver’s back, but not connected by a manifold. With independent doubles, a first stage is simply attached to the valve on each cylinder. Similar to the case with an isolation manifold, this arrangement offers some advantage in the event of a failure in the neck o-ring or burst disk of one cylinder. However, it also presents several disadvantages. First, periodically and repeatedly throughout his dive, the diver will need to switch from one regulator to another, in order to balance the quantity of gas being consumed from each cylinder. This is required for reasons related to both gas management and buoyancy characteristics. Second, in the event of a regulator failure, the diver will not only lose use of that regulator, but also will lose access to the gas supply in the cylinder to which it is attached.

Another increasingly popular option is the use of sidemounted cylinders. These are independent cylinders worn on the side of the divers body rather than on the front. Sidemount shares many of the advantages and disadvantages for independent doubles. In addition sidemount allows for easier access to the valves in the case of a free flow and a lower overall profile when vertical clearance is a problem such as in some overhead environments. However, hose routing and cylinder attachment can be more complicated and the width of the setup can make it poorly suited for hard boat diving.

It is possible to achieve redundancy in first stage regulators, while using only a single cylinder. This is accomplished by having the cylinder fitted with a dual-outlet valve, which then allows two first stages to be attached. Of course, by itself, this configuration provides no redundancy in the diver’s gas supply in the event of an o-ring or burst disk failure.

When using only a single cylinder, redundancy in gas supply may be provided through the addition of a pony bottle, worn on the diver’s back alongside his primary cylinder. In such a case it is vitally important that this pony bottle be of sufficient volume to allow the diver to return from his deepest depth and complete all required decompression stops on his way to the surface. Of course, when diving in an overhead environment, the technical diver must consider not only his vertical depth from the surface, but also his horizontal depth into the wreck or cave.

Cylinder valves are often available with a choice of either DIN or yoke fittings. In many cases either will work equally well. However, technical divers tend to prefer the DIN fitting because it completely encloses and internally traps that critical O-ring where the first stage mates to the valve, and its threaded (screw-in) connection generally provides a more secure attachment in the event of accidental impact (such as colliding with an unnoticed overhead obstacle while diving inside a cave or wreck).

As will be addressed later in this course, technical divers may employ breathing gases other than air. Whenever an alternate gas is used, the primary cylinders need to be appropriately prepared and labeled, and a completed contents tag should be affixed to the cylinders.

## Auxiliary Cylinders

While the sport diver typically uses only a single breathing mixture during a dive, the technical diver has the option of employing multiple gases for maximum benefit throughout his dive.

With appropriate training, a technical diver may utilize a high-content deco gas (50% to 100% oxygen) during his staged decompression stops, either for physiological advantage or to significantly reduce the time required at those stops.

Aux_Cylinders.jpg

A pony-size cylinder typically is used for the deco gas. Sometimes it is carried by the diver throughout his entire dive, while other times it may be left by the diver in a rendezvous location for later retrieval. It is normally attached to the front of the BC, with its valve-end clipped to a D-ring on the diver’s chest and its base-end clipped to another D-ring near the diver’s hip. Some divers prefer to wear the deco cylinder diagonally across the torso, while others prefer to have it attached more toward one side and tucked under the arm.

The high-content deco gas, if inadvertently used at a deeper depth, will pose a significant risk of CNS (central nervous system) oxygen toxicity. Thus, it is standard practice to label this cylinder quite prominently, for ready identification by both the diver and his buddy. In addition, the deco cylinder is normally carried with the regulator pressurized to preclude water from entering the regulator, but with the valve turned off so as to minimize the risk of accidentally breathing this mix at depth. This same procedure, with the regulator pressurized and the valve turned-off, also works well when the deco cylinder is left at a rendezvous location, as it prevents any free-flow loss of gas during the diver’s absence.

In addition to the deco gas, some technical divers also elect to carry a travel gas in an additional auxiliary cylinder. This travel gas may be used during the diver’s descent prior to switching over to the bottom gas in his primary cylinders, and/or during the ascent prior to switching over to his deco gas. A travel cylinder is rigged in the same manner as the deco cylinder; some divers prefer to wear the deco and travel cylinders on opposite sides of their body, while others prefer to carry them both on the same side and positioned one below the other.
