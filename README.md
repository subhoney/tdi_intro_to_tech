# TDI Intro to Tech

## Purpose

This is a reproduction of TDI's eLearning platform for their Intro to Tech Diving course. I typically learn by physical interaction; this is my way of preserving the manual forever outside of the TDI paywall and interacting with it such that I learn the material on my own terms.

Up-to-date as of Feb 2024.
