## Welcome to the TDI Introduction to Tech course

TDI is Technical Diving International, the largest and most widely recognized technical diver training organization worldwide. We are committed to offering the highest quality programs, supported by the latest materials, with the most up to date practical information and innovative techniques. Our instructors are held to the highest standards to ensure quality training in all TDI programs conducted worldwide.

In the past, many sport divers were unnecessarily intimidated by technical diving, and thus were reluctant to explore this advanced aspect of recreational diving. Some may have been puzzled by the apparently alien equipment. Others might have had a concern about venturing beyond the traditional sport diving boundaries. Many really didn’t understand what technical diving is all about; a few didn’t even know it existed. At the time there was no single resource geared towards the sport diver that provided an appropriate overview of technical diving.

Intro to Tech is a relatively new addition to the TDI training curriculum, first introduced in 2007. The purpose of this manual, and this course, is to introduce the sport diver to the concepts of technical diving. It focuses primarily on defining the various activities, explaining the equipment, outlining the options, and previewing the information that will be further addressed during formal training in each specialty area. Along the way it will dispel some myths and explore relevant topics. It is not intended, by itself, to make you a full-fledged technical diver; instead, it will help lay a foundation for subsequent technical training, while also enabling you to make informed decisions about your own training path.

We trust that you will find this program both informative and beneficial.

## Some Basic Terminology

As recognized by most authorities, both inside and outside the dive industry, there are three distinct categories of diving: recreational, commercial, and scientific. Recreational diving is a hobby-type activity in which participation is based upon personal enjoyment, while both commercial and scientific diving conversely are vocational pursuits. Naturally, each category of diving is subject to its own protocols and participant qualifications.

Even within the dive industry, some have misconstrued the term recreational diving as applying only to a specific and limited range of sport diving activities, and have mistakenly labeled technical diving as something other than recreational diving. In fact, technical diving is an advanced form of recreational diving. Thus, throughout this text the term sport diving will be used to identify the more traditional aspects of recreational diving, and thereby segregate such activities from the advanced practices and procedures of technical diving.

## Key Contrasts: Technical vs. Sport Diving

As will be readily apparent to most readers, sport diving represents the majority of overall recreational diving activities. Sport diving is widely enjoyed by many participants, often in warm and exotic locations, typically using a relatively simple equipment kit and often requiring only basic entry-level training. Yes, there are advanced sport dives that require some additional training and perhaps a little extra equipment, but for many participants, these advanced activities represent the exception rather than the norm in their diving routine. Most new divers consider their entry level training to have been quite comprehensive, but in actuality, this initial curriculum is streamlined to present only information that is deemed essential; and essential is often defined in terms of the diving activities and environments to which the average sport diver will most likely be exposed.

There is a clear consensus among certification agencies concerning the scope of sport diving; in fact, sport diving is most often identified by its well-established parameters and limitations. The standard scuba unit for sport divers is open circuit scuba with a single cylinder. Novice divers are usually restricted to a depth of 20 metres or 60 feet, while the maximum depth limit for all sport diving is frequently cited as 40 metres or 130 feet. Sport divers are cautioned that they should always avoid entering any overhead environment. Most significantly, sport diving is exclusively no-decompression (or no-stop) diving. The governing principle in sport diving is that the participant will be able to make a direct ascent to the surface at any time.

Conversely, technical diving often is characterized by the fact that it involves activities and environments that are beyond the boundaries of traditional sport diving. It might include staged decompression, alternate breathing gases, or penetration into the dark recesses of wrecks and caves. No, technical divers are not mere renegades who disregard the traditional rules. Technical diving truly is a discipline unto itself. It combines appropriate education, experience, and equipment to enable its practitioners to soundly and safely engage in these types of advanced diving activities.

As will be easily appreciated by the reader, when applied to technical diving, the term essential now encompasses a significantly broader base of knowledge and skills.

By its very nature, technical diving frequently requires additional and/or specialized equipment, far exceeding the traditional scuba unit used by the sport diver. A technical diver usually will stand out from the crowd on a boat shared with sport divers, simply because of his equipment. However, the equipment by itself does not necessarily make a technical diver; this equipment is simply a means to an end, allowing the tech diver to participate in these advanced diving activities.

A sport diver may have the luxury of adopting a rather casual approach to routine diving. With a little experience under his belt, he might be able to gear up and jump into the water with only minimal thought. He may have a loosely-defined route in mind, or perhaps just intends to wander around for a while underwater. Then he'll simply end his dive and surface when . . .

. . . his dive computer suggests an approaching NDL; or
. . . he is beginning to run low on air in his cylinder; or
. . . it's almost time for his dive boat to depart this site; or
. . . he encounters some type of unexpected problem.

The hallmark of technical diving is precise dive planning and execution. Critical components of the planning process include a well-defined route and objective, depth-time considerations and deco obligations, gas selection and effective gas management, and contingency issues. Nothing is routinely left to happenstance. Many technical dives involve staged decompression and, as succinctly noted in the NOAA Diving Manual (4th edition, 2001), "there is no such thing as a casual decompression dive."

Rightly or wrongly, advanced training sometimes might be viewed as optional for the sport diver; however, it is unquestionably a prerequisite in technical diving. Diver safety is the critical factor. Technical diving is not the place for random trial-and-error experimentation by an uninformed amateur, because often there is simply less margin for error. After venturing deep into an overhead environment, or once committed to a decompression profile, the diver will no longer have the option of a direct ascent to the surface. The technical diver must be fully prepared, in terms of equipment, personal skills, and mindset, to effectively deal with any reasonably foreseeable contingency that might arise during a dive.

Technical diving places a heavy emphasis on self-sufficiency, yet at the same time mandates a well-organized and mission-oriented team approach. Close coordination is required among the members of a dive team in terms of gas matching, profile matching, and experience matching. Depending upon the requirements for a particular dive, the members of the team also might extend beyond the primary divers to include additional in-water safety divers and surface support personnel.

## A Bit of History

Modern scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) was invented by Emile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1943. Some earlier systems certainly existed, but left much to be desired. As a French naval officer, Cousteau himself had experienced the dire shortcomings of more primitive underwater equipment. Following deployment by Allied forces in the latter days of World War II, scuba came home to the civilian world with some of the returning veterans.

In the earliest days of recreational diving, the typical dive instructor most frequently was an ex-military diver, and the early civilian training programs naturally mimicked the military regimens. It was not unusual, at that time, for recreational diver training to be extraordinarily lengthy and detailed, as well as physically demanding. Training tended to be all-inclusive, encompassing the full spectrum of all possible diving activities, and routinely addressing a number of now-obscure diving concepts; in particular, decompression diving was a standard part of the training. Consistent with its military heritage and philosophy, diving at that time was not intended for the average person. Clearly the extensive prerequisite training served as a barrier for many, and active participation was effectively limited to the select few who could measure up to those standards.

However, it was soon recognized that sport diving actually could be something quite different than military diving, and therefore the training could be treated accordingly.

Los Angeles County was home to the first civilian diver training organization in the USA in 1954, and by the mid 1960’s several other certification agencies had appeared, all under the new banner of recreational diving. A primary goal was standardization and sanctioning of sport diver training. Anxious to attract wider participation, yet with a vigilant eye toward safety, ongoing efforts have been made to dramatically streamline entry-level training while simultaneously narrowing the types of activities deemed appropriate for sport divers. In the process, sport diving evolved into the avocation that we know today, with its standardized training requirements and its well-defined parameters and limitations.

Undoubtedly, during the ensuing years, a few participants felt unnecessarily constrained by the boundaries of sport diving. Some of these individuals started to look elsewhere for tools and techniques that would help expand the range of their personal diving activities. Their focus was turned back toward military diving protocols, as well as forward toward the more recent developments in commercial and scientific diving.

The term technical diving was coined by AquaCorps magazine in 1991 to identify certain advanced diving activities that were clearly outside the mainstream of recreational diving. Though the label itself was new, in fact technical diving already had been around for a number of years, and was continuing to grow in popularity.
