## Welcome to the TDI Introduction to Tech course

TDI is Technical Diving International, the largest and most widely recognized technical diver training organization worldwide. We are committed to offering the highest quality programs, supported by the latest materials, with the most up to date practical information and innovative techniques. Our instructors are held to the highest standards to ensure quality training in all TDI programs conducted worldwide.

In the past, many sport divers were unnecessarily intimidated by technical diving, and thus were reluctant to explore this advanced aspect of recreational diving. Some may have been puzzled by the apparently alien equipment. Others might have had a concern about venturing beyond the traditional sport diving boundaries. Many really didn’t understand what technical diving is all about; a few didn’t even know it existed. At the time there was no single resource geared towards the sport diver that provided an appropriate overview of technical diving.

Intro to Tech is a relatively new addition to the TDI training curriculum, first introduced in 2007. The purpose of this manual, and this course, is to introduce the sport diver to the concepts of technical diving. It focuses primarily on defining the various activities, explaining the equipment, outlining the options, and previewing the information that will be further addressed during formal training in each specialty area. Along the way it will dispel some myths and explore relevant topics. It is not intended, by itself, to make you a full-fledged technical diver; instead, it will help lay a foundation for subsequent technical training, while also enabling you to make informed decisions about your own training path.

We trust that you will find this program both informative and beneficial.

## Some Basic Terminology

As recognized by most authorities, both inside and outside the dive industry, there are three distinct categories of diving: recreational, commercial, and scientific. Recreational diving is a hobby-type activity in which participation is based upon personal enjoyment, while both commercial and scientific diving conversely are vocational pursuits. Naturally, each category of diving is subject to its own protocols and participant qualifications.

Even within the dive industry, some have misconstrued the term recreational diving as applying only to a specific and limited range of sport diving activities, and have mistakenly labeled technical diving as something other than recreational diving. In fact, technical diving is an advanced form of recreational diving. Thus, throughout this text the term sport diving will be used to identify the more traditional aspects of recreational diving, and thereby segregate such activities from the advanced practices and procedures of technical diving.

## Key Contrasts: Technical vs. Sport Diving

As will be readily apparent to most readers, sport diving represents the majority of overall recreational diving activities. Sport diving is widely enjoyed by many participants, often in warm and exotic locations, typically using a relatively simple equipment kit and often requiring only basic entry-level training. Yes, there are advanced sport dives that require some additional training and perhaps a little extra equipment, but for many participants, these advanced activities represent the exception rather than the norm in their diving routine. Most new divers consider their entry level training to have been quite comprehensive, but in actuality, this initial curriculum is streamlined to present only information that is deemed essential; and essential is often defined in terms of the diving activities and environments to which the average sport diver will most likely be exposed.

There is a clear consensus among certification agencies concerning the scope of sport diving; in fact, sport diving is most often identified by its well-established parameters and limitations. The standard scuba unit for sport divers is open circuit scuba with a single cylinder. Novice divers are usually restricted to a depth of 20 metres or 60 feet, while the maximum depth limit for all sport diving is frequently cited as 40 metres or 130 feet. Sport divers are cautioned that they should always avoid entering any overhead environment. Most significantly, sport diving is exclusively no-decompression (or no-stop) diving. The governing principle in sport diving is that the participant will be able to make a direct ascent to the surface at any time.

Conversely, technical diving often is characterized by the fact that it involves activities and environments that are beyond the boundaries of traditional sport diving. It might include staged decompression, alternate breathing gases, or penetration into the dark recesses of wrecks and caves. No, technical divers are not mere renegades who disregard the traditional rules. Technical diving truly is a discipline unto itself. It combines appropriate education, experience, and equipment to enable its practitioners to soundly and safely engage in these types of advanced diving activities.

As will be easily appreciated by the reader, when applied to technical diving, the term essential now encompasses a significantly broader base of knowledge and skills.

By its very nature, technical diving frequently requires additional and/or specialized equipment, far exceeding the traditional scuba unit used by the sport diver. A technical diver usually will stand out from the crowd on a boat shared with sport divers, simply because of his equipment. However, the equipment by itself does not necessarily make a technical diver; this equipment is simply a means to an end, allowing the tech diver to participate in these advanced diving activities.
